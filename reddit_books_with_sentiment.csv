My thoughts on A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin,"I have similar feelings to this book as I do to warm sunlight or a fresh autumn breath. This book is comfortable to me. Le Guin does world building in a way that is simple and interesting and powerful. I honestly can not be very unbiased when talking about Ursula K. Le Guin. Even before I read her books or poems, I developed a proximity admiration for her from the ways that my older brothers would speak about her works. I came into this book knowing I was going to like it.

I originally started this book 1-2 years ago. I was in college and constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown, so distractions like this book got cast aside for what felt like more pressing matters. Yet, in that time a certain quote from the book rooted itself in my memory, and it is probably one of my favorite quotes . It highlighted the feelings of college for me very well.  It says “You thought, as a boy, that a mage is one who can do anything. So I thought, once. So did we all. And the truth is that as a man's real power grows and his knowledge widens, ever the way he can follow grows narrower: until at last he chooses nothing, but does only and wholly what he must do…” This quote made me feel like it was okay and normal that things were already out of my control. This feeling and my general admiration made it inevitable that I would start this book again.

This book has wonderfully realized settings and imaginative story beats. The way that Le Guin describes these islands and their cultures, their diversity in thought even within their own cultures. Her worlds feel real even when fantastical. Ever since I started reading I’ve always had an aversion to the overly-detailed descriptions of settings, but the way that Le Guin does it often doesn’t feel like just placing down a setting. There are times the setting tells just as much plot as the main meat of the story. Though there were occasional times where I felt that it dragged on for a bit, these were short enough and the parts I wanted to get to motivated me to get through it.

My personal interpretation of the shadow, though I might not be breaking any new ground with this, is that the shadow was a manifestation of Ged’s fear, anxiety, and regret. As he runs away from it, it gains power. As he faces his fear it loses power. The final moment of him accepting it into himself as a part of him was him accepting his fears and regrets as a part of his story and being. I really liked it, and it spoke to my own personal life problems.

Anyway, in summary, book good. 4.5/5. Will prolly read the next one. 

Also I am sooo much stronger than you and bigger than you and cooler than you, so there’s that.

"A New Spring: Robert Silverberg's ""The New Springtime"".","Finally got to read one of Silverberg's novels, this one being titled ""The New Springtime"". This is part of a two book series and, once again, this one is the sequel to the first book. Of course of which I haven't read yet.

The People had come out from the many eons of ice so they could rebuild the world at Winter's End. But the hjjks and their queen also have a desire to rule this new springtime. The hjjks are intelligent, united and powerful, while the People are still tribal, ignorant and split into various warring factions.

Now the People are offered a peace treaty from the hjjks. This vision of security is both seductive and beautiful, but also Inhuman. Blood will run through the earth if the tribes refuse. The people themselves will either be exterminated, or they will destroy a very ancient and wise race. If the People accept the hjjks they would survive the Winter, but only to lose their newly discover humanity forever.

Despite my ever obvious blunder I loved this book! It's slow going but things do build up and it gets really interesting. Plenty of intrigue and mystery going on the story that really makes it more so! Probably nowhere on the same level as Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" but it really is great!

Obviously I'm going to have to get my hands on the first book ""At Winter's End"", just to get more of a grasp of the whole story.

Lonesome Dove and East of Eden,"So I’m 75% through East of Eden and have finished LD and Streets of Laredo.

For example: SPOILER east of eden >!charles dying in E of E is by letter, Adam and Charles’s father is just that he’s died!<

Finished The Housemaid by Freida McFadden,"3.5 ⭐️

I have to say, this book left me both entertained and confused. It had so many twists and turns that it was definitely fun to read, but when it comes to the actual resolution of the story, it felt like… a whole lot of nothing.

I still think Millie isn’t telling the whole truth. She keeps lying, or at least hiding things, and I’m pretty sure that’s something we’ll continue to explore later in book 2... but I’m not sure if I want to explore it. The mystery around Officer Connors’ daughter also had me guessing for a while. I even thought maybe Millie was his daughter who changed her name after doing something terrible, but then… who is she really? Probably something else we’ll find out as the story goes on, and again, I don’t think I want to know.

As for the ending, didn’t hate that she turned in some sort of “hitwoman”. In fact, I was actually fine with that part as that’s what she’s meant to do. What bothered me was how neat and orchestrated everything felt at the end. The big reveal tied up too cleanly, almost like all those earlier challenges were intentional just to fit the thriller formula.

With every twist, I felt surprised and then conflicted. Don’t even get me started on the “Get Rid of Your Husband” guide. It felt so “Gone Girl” coded that I didn’t enjoy it as much. 

Overall, I’m giving it a 3.5 stars because it was enjoyable and fast-paced, but I’m still confused and not entirely satisfied with how it all wrapped up.",29,28,say book left entertain confus mani twist turn definit fun read come actual resolut stori felt like whole lot noth still think milli isnt tell whole truth keep lie least hide thing im pretti sure that someth well continu explor later book im sure want explor mysteri around offic connor daughter also guess even thought mayb milli daughter chang name someth terribl realli probabl someth els well find stori goe dont think want know end didnt hate turn sort hitwoman fact actual fine part that she meant bother neat orchestr everyth felt end big reveal tie cleanli almost like earlier challeng intent fit thriller formula everi twist felt surpris conflict dont even get start get rid husband guid felt gone girl code didnt enjoy much overal im give star enjoy fastpac im still confus entir satisfi wrap,negative,-1,0
Just finished The Ruins by Scott Smith,"My goodness, what a book to read after not reading any books for years. Where to begin?

Typical college kids not thinking with their heads, ultimately leading to their demise. I'm in my mid 30s, and the amount of times I grew so frustrated at these young people making awful decisions that it was legitimately making me hate read. Now, I was rooting for the them whole time, but as I kept reading, I knew not all were going to make it.

Jeff pissed me off the most, but I couldn't help but respect him at the same time. He seemed to at least try and be logical, but was quite dickish about it. And honestly deservedly so, the rest, besides Mathias, were just plain idiots. At least Jeff understood the severity of their situation and tried to survive from the get go.

Mathias, eh, a bit neutral. After seeing his brother, I think he just gave up and went on autopilot, agreeing to whatever the group decided. And I can't exactly blame him. I'd probably be the same if I saw my brutally killed brother's corpse while with a group of strangers.

Eric i was ok with until he believed the vines over Stacy. That part really pissed me off. Just a bumbling idiot.

Amy was fine. No big qualms with her to be honest. Same with Stacy, although she was quite ditsy and stupid. Again, all college kids, so you can't exactly fault them for not being park rangers that can survive in the wilderness, especially with a carnivorous plant.

Anyway, I really enjoyed this book. I was really hoping at the end Stacy would grab a vine and throw it at the mayans, past the salt ring surrounding the mound. Or walk toward them and make them shoot her.

"theory of the hack: What makes an artist a ""hack""?","I loved this post by author Emily Zhou about what literary hackdom is; how to identify it as a different thing than merely being a ""bad artist""; and what hackdom tells us about it's opposite, which is genius:

1. ""The hack is not the same thing as a bad artist or a writer, or someone who makes what they know to be bad work for money. The hack is something else, a social as well as artistic type that has existed since the beginning of capitalism, at least. Plenty of people seem to know a hack when they see one; fewer notice that any individual artist or writer worthy of the name has siblings everywhere, whose work shares certain aesthetic qualities and whose personalities are congruent with each other.""

""6. The unstoppable confidence of the hack, which hinders their improvement, is phenomenologically indistinguishable from the confidence, the fluency, that true geniuses have. One imagines the inner lives of Bach or Balzac had certain things in common with those of the hack.

7. One is tempted to say, “but not those of Beethoven or Kafka.” But it does not matter whether any individual hack struggles mightily to produce their work, or is crucified daily with self-doubt. The trouble is in their taste: the standards used to evaluate the work have seemingly been calibrated incorrectly. They have climbed some alien Parnassus to get to their mediocrity, and usually have stopped early and declared that they are on the peak.""

"Most disappointing title of the year, so far?","Mine is Eruption, by ""Michael Crichton"" and James Patterson. I knew going into it that it wasn't going to be a masterpiece, but at worst I expected a quick and exciting airport book. Quick it was. But my word, what an atrocious book. Poorly written characters, a cookie cutter plot, glaring plot holes, and just a waste of time. And that ending .... My God. After a day or so,I chalked up the decision for the ending to Patterson not being aware of Crichton's opinions on global warming, and his position that nature couldn't be helped out. But Patterson didn't get it, so it all just fell apart.

"What is the most unforgettable smell, taste, or sound described in a book that stuck in your head long after reading?","Writers often focus on visuals, but some of the most powerful moments come from senses we cannot see.

I remember reading Perfume: The Story of a Murderer by Patrick Süskind. The way Süskind described scents was so vivid that I could almost smell them. The description of the tannery where Grenouille worked, the stink of animal hides, blood, and sweat mixed together, was so intense that I could almost smell it. It made me feel both disgusted and amazed at how powerful the writing was.

Another example is in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, when the Hogwarts feast is described with roast chicken, sausages, treacle tart, and pumpkin juice. Reading it as a kid made me crave food I had never even tasted before, and that feeling stayed with me.

And in The Road by Cormac McCarthy, the silence of the empty, burned out world was described as barren and dead to the point that it made me hear nothingness. It was chilling, like silence itself was a sound.

These details stayed with me long after finishing the books.

I wonder which sensory detail from a book stuck with you long after reading, a smell, a taste, or a sound that you could almost experience yourself?

I prolonged its borrowing from my library five times, fell asleep several nights reading it (which is not so bad for a bedtime reading). Even read some analysis, but the whole book just couldn't catch me and I couldn't understand the fandom around it.

"The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu, My feelings and takes","The purpose of this post is less as a review and more like a receptacle I can word-vomit into for posterity sake. So, sorry if this isn’t super coherent or even enjoyable to read. And also, fuck you. I can do what I want. 

I thoroughly enjoyed The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu. This is my first ever sci-fi book. I had just read The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro, and after being in that post-book stupor, I decided that I needed to read something a bit more exciting. After reading some reviews, with positive reviews saying that it is the best book they’ve read and negative reviews saying that the book is misogynistic, I dived into the book and read it over the course of 2-3 weeks. Since this book is sorta a slow burn, I was skeptical at first. The first couple pages of world building felt hard to piece together, but as the story progressed and characters were developed, I was hooked. 

If I had to sum up what I liked about this book in one word I would say that the book was engaging. After the set up in the first 70 or so pages, the mysteries and theories just keep you on the hook for the rest of the book. And the pay off at the end of the book! I’m so glad that I don’t study physics or computer science, because I feel like science fiction was right in that perfect space where it didn’t break my suspension of disbelief too often. Speaking of, the sci-fi aspects of the book feel very grounded. It doesn’t get star-wars/star trek levels of sci-fi until very close to the end of the book. This makes the book even more engaging because the sci-fi feels so close to us. The setting of the earthly science in the book is basically our current level of tech except slightly more advanced. 

I think that all the characters ranged from great to inoffensive. Shi Qiang, he’s the goat and I love him and his asshole detective down-to-earth energy. Everyone else, they’re alright. 

The story really picks up and just keeps on running. I really like how the reveal of aliens being behind all the shenaniganery isn’t shown until almost 2/3rds through the book. It really does the book a disservice reading reviews because I think the alien reveal is awesome and doesn’t feel at all forced. The plot thread about Ye Weinje receiving and sending messages to aliens, I think that I actually audibly gasped. I really enjoyed reading this book. 

Some of the negative reviews of this book said that it felt like there were plot threads that didn’t lead anywhere. I honestly felt like this book was pretty solid through and through, but I did feel like the parts related to the books namesake, The Three Body game, kind of dragged on. They felt a bit pretentious as they played the game with the names of a bunch of old philosophers/astronomers. I think it’s hilarious that Wang would log on and choose “Copernicus” as his gamer tag. I kinda kept thinking, “how is this a game? This doesn’t play like a game at all.” Like I know that the point is to find like minded people to indoctrinate them, but it took me out a bit. Kinda sucks that the “worst” parts of the book were what the book was named after. 

Other negative reviews said that the book was misogynistic? If the book was, I certainly didn’t pick up on it. I remember reading that it was because many of the female characters were described as “slim.” I’m sure I’m misrepresenting their arguments a bit, but I felt like that the main female characters in the book were explored with a good amount of depth.



Overall, good book. It leaves you excited for the next one, which I will probably be reading next.

Witches of Eastwick by John Updike...sucks. It's just sucks.,"Another spontaneous book purchase that bit me in the ass. I wasn't that whelmed by the movie, but I didn't think the book would be that much worse. It's not a classic, it's obnoxious. 

It carries too much stereotypes like women hating each other, being friends to hate other women, submitting to unsatisfying, hurtful sex while treating it like a sacred mantle and just in general it's a really hard pivot from wonder of magic to women who don't need no man subcoming to being hateful hags and only that hatefulness kept them friends.

Oh, and the children. I didn't like that they all give birth at the end of the movie, but I hate that being a free woman comes with hating your children  even more. I don't even register that Jane has kids up until the last hundred pages. Sapphic motives? Just to play up the perversion I guess, because from what I've managed to catch with my too annoyed brain is that they all find men and no longer need witchcraft or friends. And of course, if the man doesn't want you, he gay. It's really that simple.

I probably missed something. Some parts were quite enjoyable, like Gabriel murder, it was creepy and well written, but a good chunk of the book is just long lists of things and actions. I'd rather read about sensual boob on boob touching in an Anne Rice novel.

The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde.,"Just completed reading this book, and I liked it. I really loved the Sybil Vane character. She seems very nice and kind, but it’s too bad that she fell in love with the protagonist, who is actually very cruel.
 
I struggled to understand some sentences, especially those from Lord Henry, and there’s a chapter that’s kind of crazy and explains a lot of unnecessary details. I don’t know how it’s necessary for the plot.
 
There are some instances where I realized that a lot of modern movies might have taken inspiration from classics like this—like when he tries to cover the body of the painter, and the scene where Dorian goes to that shady place and gets confronted by Sybil Vane’s brother.

‘Carole King’ tells the story of a songwriting giant,"Eisner interviewed many of those who orbited her subject, including producer Lou Adler and King’s late songwriting collaborator Toni Stern. They revealed that King — now 83 and a longtime environmental activist — was driven to the apex of stardom despite being a recluse who took a “long sojourn” to the backwoods of Idaho in the mid-1970s. She is a mother of four who favors Jewish tradition and domesticity but whose four marriages were unsuccessful. An earthy, wiry-haired pianist who didn’t trade on sex appeal for fame — and who charted a powerful path for women in music — King is revered as a feminist. Yet she is uncomfortable picking up that mantle. Eisner sums it up this way: “She is a puzzle whose pieces don’t quite fit, a melody that doesn’t quite resolve.”",37,2,eisner interview mani orbit subject includ produc lou adler king late songwrit collabor toni stern reveal king longtim environment activist driven apex stardom despit reclus took long sojourn backwood idaho mid mother four favor jewish tradit domest whose four marriag unsuccess earthi wiryhair pianist didnt trade sex appeal fame chart power path women music king rever feminist yet uncomfort pick mantl eisner sum way puzzl whose piec dont quit fit melodi doesnt quit resolv,neutral,0,0

"Slewfoot by Brom, a review.","Kicking off the Halloween season I just finished reading *Slewfoot*(2021) by *Brom*, a gorgeously savage folk horror fable that melds beauty and brutality masterfully. 

 Set in 1666 Puritan New England, it follows Abitha, a young Englishwoman struggling under the crushing weight of a patriarchal, superstitious community, who becomes entangled with a mysterious horned forest spirit known as Slewfoot. The premise taps into timeless fears of witchcraft, religious oppression and the blurred line between monster and savior, all wrapped in an eerie fairy tale atmosphere.

Brom's lush and grotesque prose did a great job immersing me in the oppressive, claustrophobic world of Puritan life and showcasing the vulnerability of a woman who doesn’t fit into its rigid mold. Abitha is a sympathetic and relatable protagonist and Slewfoot himself is a fascinatingly ambiguous  presence, both terrifying and reverential. The antagonists are so well written that multiple times I had to take a pause so I could cuss out these bastard bitch characters. The moral tension between witchcraft, freedom and religious repression gives the narrative a grounded human experience which goes beyond its blood and pagan spectacle. This was the first time for me reading a book illustrated by the author, guaranteeing complete clarity in the visual translation of imagination which added a haunting richness to the myth and horror. 

It isnt flawless. The pacing drags at times, and horror fans familiar with folk tropes will see some twists coming. The tone occasionally wavers between mythic parable and straightforward horror, leaving a few uneven moments. But even at its weakest, the novel has a raw, hypnotic pull that keeps you reading. Slewfoot is best approached as a dark fable which is part witch story, part feminist revenge tale and part meditation on freedom and fear.

Pick it up if you enjoyed watching Robert Eggers’s The Witch (2015) and are drawn to morally ambiguous folklore and lush gothic horror. There is a high possibility you will find it a rewarding experience that is both unsettling and strangely cathartic

Try Tartan Noir Set in Glasgow If You Like Your Crime Novel Dark and Gritty,"If you like your crime novels dark, depressing, violent and generally gritty you can usually find them in books set in Glasgow.  A few authors and series to check out:

Denise Mina has three series: One featuring Maureen McDonnell a psychiatric patient as the main protagonist-the first book being Garnethill. The second features Paddy Meehan a young Catholic journalist, the first book of which is Field of Blood. The last leads with Alex Morrow an actual police officer  and the first book is Still Midnight.

Christopher Brookmyre set many of his comic crime capers in Glasgow, but later wrote entirely dark three book series about Jasmine who takes over a private Investigation agency starting with Where the Bodies are Buried.

But before either of these was William McIlVanney whose first book Laidlaw, the eponymous DI Inspector who set the standard for dark and gritty Glasgow Noir.

I have no idea if Liam McIlvanney is related to William, but his series featuring Duncan McCormack starting with The Quaker certain follows closely in the same tradition and possible ups the ante

Alex Gray's DI Lorimer series is another set in Glasgow.

Others authors worth checking out include Louise Welch's The Cutting Room and The Bullet Trick

Also worthy of mention is Gillespie and I by Jane Harris though it seems comic to start by the end it is as dark as anything you'll read.

And of course I can't leave with mentioning Iain Banks The Crow Road a classic book in its own right as well as a great dark tale of crime and mystery set in yes, Glasgow.",124,31,like crime novel dark depress violent gener gritti usual find book set glasgow author seri check denis mina three seri one featur maureen mcdonnel psychiatr patient main protagonistth first book garnethil second featur paddi meehan young cathol journalist first book field blood last lead alex morrow actual polic offic first book still midnight christoph brookmyr set mani comic crime caper glasgow later wrote entir dark three book seri jasmin take privat investig agenc start bodi buri either william mcilvanney whose first book laidlaw eponym di inspector set standard dark gritti glasgow noir idea liam mcilvanney relat william seri featur duncan mccormack start quaker certain follow close tradit possibl up ant alex gray di lorim seri anoth set glasgow other author worth check includ louis welch cut room bullet trick also worthi mention gillespi jane harri though seem comic start end dark anyth youll read cours cant leav mention iain bank crow road classic book right well great dark tale crime mysteri set ye glasgow,positive,1,0
"Do you read holiday-themed books? If so, when do you start them?","Since roughly 2021, I've accumulated a backlog of holiday/Christmas-themed novels on my physical TBR, as well as saved more on Libby, Hoopla, and my main library account.

A Giant Leap for Mankind: Red Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson,"I started appreciating science fiction only recently, when my literary tastes slightly changed. And, I must say, this book and these series in general, are some of the most impressive examples of SF mastery I’ve read until now.

*The Mars Trilogy* by Kim Stanley Robinson, details Humanity’s successful colonization of the Red Planet and then its subsequent terraforming into a life-sustaining state over a period that spans more than a century. *Red Mars* is the only book in the trilogy I’ve read until now, so I’ll center on that.

*Red Mars* begins in 2026, with the First Hundred colonists arriving on Mars and beginning the construction of human settlements and scientific centers, as they start exploring and studying the planet. There are various characters, with the mission being a joint US – Russian venture, so I won’t get into many details about specific ones here. Over a period of almost sixty or so years, we follow the humans of Mars as they slowly create communities and form a new society, up until >!an eventual revolution that starts against the Earth governments and the transnational corporations that control Mars.!<

Throughout the book, the main question posed is If Humanity should terraform Mars in order to fit its needs, or If they should leave the planet as is. These positions are represented by the “Green” and “Red” factions of the colonists respectively, who form proto-political groups around this question. Alongside them are other movements like the anarchist-like ideas of Russian cosmonaut Arkady Bogdanov and the followers of Areophany, a new religious movement that worships Mars itself in a kind of naturalist religion.

I won’t lie by saying that this is a difficult book to read. KSR has the habit of heavily info-dumping in every other page, talking in great detail about the technical, biological and ecological ideas, plans and consequences that unfold in the course of the Martian colonization. I won’t lie that a lot of it passed over my head, as I don’t have the knowledge necessary to understand it all. So, this can impede your reading experience a little, although I must admit it is extremely interesting and impressing, and a very realistic look into the details of space colonization and terraforming. It has everything from drilling moholes on the planet’s surface to release heat, to constructing a space elevator connecting Mars to Earth by the later stages of the book.

I will certainly finish the Mars trilogy, since it is, some of the most realistic depictions of space colonization out there. And since this idea of Martian habitation has come to the forefront once more, I believe the books can be surprisingly up to date. I definitely recommend them to anyone that wants a more realistic, “hard” science fiction storyline.",131,57,start appreci scienc fiction recent literari tast slightli chang must say book seri gener impress exampl sf masteri ive read mar trilog kim stanley robinson detail human success colon red planet subsequ terraform lifesustain state period span centuri red mar book trilog ive read ill center red mar begin first hundr colonist arriv mar begin construct human settlement scientif center start explor studi planet variou charact mission joint us russian ventur wont get mani detail specif one period almost sixti year follow human mar slowli creat commun form new societi eventu revolut start earth govern transnat corpor control mar throughout book main question pose human terraform mar order fit need leav planet posit repres green red faction colonist respect form protopolit group around question alongsid movement like anarchistlik idea russian cosmonaut arkadi bogdanov follow areophani new religi movement worship mar kind naturalist religion wont lie say difficult book read ksr habit heavili infodump everi page talk great detail technic biolog ecolog idea plan consequ unfold cours martian colon wont lie lot pass head dont knowledg necessari understand imped read experi littl although must admit extrem interest impress realist look detail space colon terraform everyth drill mohol planet surfac releas heat construct space elev connect mar earth later stage book certainli finish mar trilog sinc realist depict space colon sinc idea martian habit come forefront believ book surprisingli date definit recommend anyon want realist hard scienc fiction storylin,positive,1,0
Frankenstein (1818 Text) by Mary Shelley,"The 1818 text is technically my second read-through as I've read the revised 1831 text about half a year ago. I'll summarize it and say that I much preferred the 1818 text as the revisions and added text to the 1831 version felt a bit off toneally, pacing, and didn't fit with the darker aspects of Frankenstein's narrative.

There's not much else I can say that hasn't already been discussed a thousand times over. But my literary love for Frankenstein as a gothic horror masterpiece has solidified itself and became stronger on my second read through. I haven't felt as strong of emotions as reading other gothic texts as I have with this one. The way Shelley was able to describe the pitfalls, empathy, tragedy, and selfishness of the Monster, Frankenstein, and other major characters added so much to the overall themes. Also, I forgot just how beautiful and descriptive the prose was for anything involving nature and the various sceneries that are described in vivid detail. Such a juxtaposition from the beauty of nature to the darkness of humanity and man's creations! 

Anyone whose read both versions of Frankenstein's texts, which did prefer?

"""Bombadilling"" - Cutting book characters as a favorable(?) outcome for movie adaptations","I've been thinking about this a lot over the past few minutes, and I'm wondering if there are other examples where movie adaptations are argued to be better by their complete exclusion of a character from the source material.

I read *The Lord of the Rings* for the first time this year, also having never watched the movies. Aside from enjoying myself a great deal by the end of it all, I actively reflected upon how I enjoyed the part of Fellowship where they encountered Tom Bombadil. It was a bit silly, a bit fun, a bit weird, and I generally enjoyed the vibe of that particularly slice of the adventure.

Not long thereafter, I watched the extended cut version of Fellowship for the first time, and I was disappointed to discover that Bombadil was nowhere to be found! It wasn't long after that when I learned that most seem to think this was a good choice! Turns out, few people share my affection for Bombadil, and instead think that his character's exclusion from the movie was the correct choice.

I can confidently say that my personal movie-watching experience was lessened (not by much, but still) by a lack of Bombadil. I was greatly looking forward to seeing the way at least SOME of that piece of Fellowship's story was portrayed in a visual manner.

Now if I'm being completely honest, the extended edition is already long enough as it is. Adding Bombadil to the mix probably would have been asking too much for the movie's runtime even on an extended cut. But that didn't stop me from being disappointed nonetheless!

To those who were glad that Bombadil was cut from the movies, did you read the books first or did you watch the movies first? Because I do wonder if I may have felt differently about Bombadil as a character in the book if I had watched the movies first instead. Maybe that would have made him feel way outta left field and entirely superfluous.",131,141,ive think lot past minut im wonder exampl movi adapt argu better complet exclus charact sourc materi read lord ring first time year also never watch movi asid enjoy great deal end activ reflect upon enjoy part fellowship encount tom bombadil bit silli bit fun bit weird gener enjoy vibe particularli slice adventur long thereaft watch extend cut version fellowship first time disappoint discov bombadil nowher found wasnt long learn seem think good choic turn peopl share affect bombadil instead think charact exclus movi correct choic confid say person moviewatch experi lessen much still lack bombadil greatli look forward see way least piec fellowship stori portray visual manner im complet honest extend edit alreadi long enough ad bombadil mix probabl would ask much movi runtim even extend cut didnt stop disappoint nonetheless glad bombadil cut movi read book first watch movi first wonder may felt differ bombadil charact book watch movi first instead mayb would made feel way outta left field entir superflu,positive,1,0
All the Lovers in the Night by Mieko Kawakami: An Intimate Yearning for Connection,"Mieko Kawakami’s *All the Lovers in the Night* speaks to the part of the human that yearns for connection. It illustrates, too, the difficulty of reaching out and making those connections, especially in the aftermath of deep and abiding trauma.

The novel follows the unhappy life of a young woman, Fuyuko, who works as a proofreader. This woman is the “dictionary definition of a miserable person”. Fuyuko calls herself so on the occasion of seeing her own reflection during a blood drive; it is an apt if unfortunate description, and it is impossible to examine this novel without at least touching upon Kawakami’s words here.

Fuyuko’s portrayal is a frank examination of a woman stuck in place. She is good at her job, detail-oriented and conscientious, but there is at first a curious vacancy of any emotional dimension to her accomplishments as a proofreader. This vacancy gives way to the realisation that there really is nothing Fuyuko gains from her work by way of spiritual sustenance. Her approach towards proofreading is reminiscent of an automaton at work: when she at one point describes the way in which she forgets everything about a proofread title after she finishes the project, I was made to think of a computer’s disk drive, wiped clean and overwritten by the next assignment, and the next.

The desire for connection, the need for love at long last allows Fuyuko to reach out to another human being. These break the stifling veil of silence that chokes the novel’s protagonist and she is at long last capable of reaching out to another. Kawakami’s final chapter avoids the saccharine sweetness of a *Jane Eyre*\-style ending but rather brings to the fore a very different relationship.

In some ways, I was reminded of Rachel Cusk’s *Outline* trilogy while reading this: here, too, there is an elision of the narrator’s identity, at least to begin with. The reader learns much more about the circumstances of Fuyuko’s life beyond the external ones. What I did learn about Fuyuko stumped me: why was she only taking an evening walk across Tokyo for her birthdays? These smaller, specific details began to create a picture of who Fuyuko was, a picture that clicks into place after the reader is shown Fuyuko through her own perspective on the reflection, that textbook definition of a miserable person. Following this and a flashback chapter in the middle of the novel, Fuyuko’s identity easier to understand if no more accessible.

What I at first took for elision was in truth the chocking weight of depression. A lingering darkness that swallows Fuyuko’s light.

Some of the most unusual and vivid sections of the novel discuss the qualities of light. Fuyuko comes alive during those, her fascination breaking through to the dark clouds of her melancholy and depression. Whether thinking about it alone or discussing the quality of light with an interlocutor, a man she meets at a cultural centre, Fuyuko brightens up. Light, the absence and presence of it, lingers in Fuyuko’s perception of the world. Kawakami plays with light with such skill; likewise, light plays with Fuyuko’s keen gaze, memorably and to *All the Lovers in the Night*‘s last page.

The Silent Gondoliers by S. Morgenstern,"A ""fable"" by the celebrated Florinese author. My very first copy of this gem was acquired over 40 years ago when I was browsing the shelves of the local bookstore and browsed past ""S. Morgenstern"", did a double-take, and came back.

Sure enough, it was a newly released story by the great Florinese master. I was ecstatic! I immediately purchased it and scurried home where I devoured it in a single session. Sadly, my first edition was misplaced during a move and when I went to purchase a copy of the then-current paperback edition, the author had, through some gross negligence, been listed as a certain ""William Goldman"". The confusion appears to have stemmed from this ""Goldman"" having once published an abridgement of the master's best known work, \_The Princess Bride\_. (I won't address the travesty of attempting to abridge a seminal Florinese work of literature.) I was devastated, but I needed to replace my book so I grudgingly purchased it despite it being a principle example of the folly of American literary capitalism.

Fast forward to ""near now"" and I once again had a hankering to read this story and once again my copy had been lost along the way. This time, however, I consulted Amazon and was rewarded with several available used copies of the first edition of \_The Silent Gondoliers\_, in hardcover, with the proper authorial attribution. Needless to say, I chose one and through the magic of Priority Mail, I soon had a copy in my hands and I once again devoured it all in a single session.

\_The Silent Gondoliers\_  is, like much of Morgenstern's work, a layered experience.  After admonishing his publishers that ""I am old, but I am alive. Perhaps as you age will find the two are not mutually exclusive."", Morgenstern begins his book with a memory of being a child in Venice on Christmas and hearing the beautiful singing of the gondoliers. Yet, nowadays, the gondoliers are silent and only a few old people now remember what it was like to hear them as they ferried their customers around the canals of Venice.

This  is the outer layer, if you will. The mystery - what silenced them? Why? Morgenstern began an investigation that, being Florinese with some Italian heritage as well, he felt uniquely qualified to conduct. He details the pursuit of this mystery with anecdotes about the insular life of gondoliers and the many colorful ways that they are like yet specially unlike other society. One particular anecdote involving a British couple who attempt to find refreshment at the gondolier's tavern (note: not ""a"" tavern, ""the"" tavern) will have the reader wishing to have been there to witness it themselves.

Morgenstern's investigations lead him to the story of Luigi, the protagonist of the story that explains the mystery that Morgenstern uncovered and eventually unravels. This is the inner layer. The full story is short - only 110 pages and those are seldom full of text and many contain no text at all; rather the wonderful illustrations of Paul Giovanopoulos. Given the brevity of the story and, as I have intimated, the fact that it can be consumed in an afternoon or less, I am loathe to give much in the way of plot summary except to say this - It is a story of the perseverance of human spirit and  finding treasure and opportunity in the midst of disaster and destruction, and the aftermath of that epiphany. In a sense it is a Christmas miracle, but only really in the sense that the climax happens to occur on Christmas - it is ""on"" Christmas, not ""about"" Christmas, if you take my meaning.

As you might conclude from my own admission of having purchased this book three separate times, twice being the exact same first edition, I personally enjoyed this story immensely and found it both entertaining and thought-provoking. This in no way is \_The Princess Bride\_, yet if you enjoyed reading that book (and even if you only ever watched the film) I believe you will find your time spent reading \_The Silent Gondoliers\_ to be time well spent.

Reading third person is confusing?,"I just read a book review that just baffled me and I wanted to discuss it. Maybe I'm just ignorant or ableist?? Idk.

So I read a review of a book that said a long the lines of: I felt confused reading this book because it was third person POV and I'm used to first person POV. I felt like I was unable to follow along.

It made me feel so sad and confused. Is reading comprehension really this bad now? I just can't understand how one POV is more confusing than the other. I can understand preferring one over the other, but not being able to read one just blows my mind. 

The book this review was about was not a difficult read (to me). It was a pretty straightforward urban fantasy. It wasn't a long (under 200 pages). 

I know that first person seems to be the preferred POV these days so I can understand this person not reading many third POV books, but I just don't see how it could be difficult to follow a book because of its POV. Am I missing something? Is first person POV that much easier to follow? Help me understand.

The Cautious Traveller’s Guide to the Wastelands by Sarah Brooks,"I just finished this and here are my thoughts on it, I'd like you hear your thoughts on my thoughts:

 \- The writing is good. Good pace, not overly descriptive but enough to get a picture in your mind, not simple and dumbed down but not pretentious or ""look how much I can use a thesaurus.""   It wasn't, for me, a quick read, but it wasn't a slog.  I actually savored the words, the story, the images.  

\- I liked the setting, the train itself is a character. I liked the story. It's not the most original story, but it's well told.  I liked the characters, even though they weren't the most fleshed out, they had enough backstory for me to understand them.  

 \- It seemed to genre jump, if that's even a thing.  It's straight up fantasy, sort of slight horror-ish, in my mind, as I read it, it  felt sort of steam punk but not, a bit Lovecraftian, and even had a touch of philosophy.   

 \- The touch of philosophy I'm talking about is The Observer Effect, from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the concept of ""you can't observe something without changing it.""  Also the ""everything is unified, we are all one"" philosophies.   I don't know if that was intentional or that's just me reading into it too much. 

 \- I really enjoyed the book, it seems to have stuck with me, I can't stop thinking about it.  It's not the greatest book I've ever read, but it seems to have impacted me enough to where I felt compelled to go on Reddit and type my thoughts out even though I know better.  

Not sure I would whole heartedly recommend it, but I would mention it to anyone looking for an interesting story.

"I recently finished reading Katabasis from R F Kuang, and as someone who loves Dante's Inferno, I found my enjoyment was greatly enhanced by doing a comparison of both texts that I wish to share","So Dante’s Inferno was the book I returned to reading as an adult with, and it is my favourite read of all time. Kuang is also a recent favourite of mine, so hearing she was set to release a book that was a love letter to Dante’s Inferno made it my most anticipated read of the year. I had been taking notes throughout my reading on how it compared and contrasted to The Divine Comedy, and thought I'd share my notes/thoughts, for anyone else who might want to enhance their reading experience in the same way. 

# Broad context of either work 

The Divine Comedy is a piece of Italian Epic Poetry written around 1308-1321 by Dante Alighieri. It was a poem of 100 stanzas, or ""cantos"". He wrote it in exile from Florence, as a way to ingratiate himself back into Florentine society, by creating a work so grand that Florence would want to claim it (and Dante as its author) as a symbol of Florence’s cultivated culture. Dante however had a tumultuous relationship with Florence, formerly being a pretty high member in Florentine society, yet overseeing in-fighting and civil wars before his exile. It's clear he still loved Florence and still wanted to be part of its cultural legacy, despite how much he hated the fractious nature of Florentine society, and this turbulent relationship he transferred into his writings. 

On the other hand, Katabasis is the most recent novel by American writer Rebecca F Kuang. Born in China, raised in Texas, before undertaking higher education through Cambridge and Oxford (and currently undertaking a PhD program through Yale) Kuang is known for writing many works of fantasy, recently including some works in the Dark Academia sub-genre. While it's clear that Kuang loves education, the pursuit of knowledge, her experiences at each institution, and what she's learned, it's also clear that she has many criticisms with the structure of such educational institutions, for the many systemic and prejudiced failings of institutes such as them, for the dark history that exists behind either institute as an institute of power, to the small scale abuses of power that can be committed by some within through even the small amounts of power they wield. She too thus transferred thus turbulent relationship into her writing, hence turning to the dark Academia genre. 

This may be surface level, but I already think this is an interesting link. Two authors writing works that they are both immensely knowledgeable and passionate about, yet still harbor some conflicting feelings within themselves about their passions. And I know some people say Kuang is very didactic in her themes or politics, which is a part of her writing which never really bothered me because, well Dante was also very didactic. And I personally think if the matter's important to either, of course they're going to make it clear in their writing.  

# Overview of either work 

Both works deal with a passage through the underworld. Inferno (is really only one part of The Divine Comedy) tells the journey of Dante (or a fictional representation of himself), lost in the wild (presumably following his real-life exile), finding a savior in the form of one of his literary inspirations, Virgil, who guides him through Hell, so that he can reach the other side, and tell the world of what he saw there, as evidence of God's divine abilities. It's only part of The Comedy though, where he then also climbs up Mount Purgatory, taking a similar look at sinners and their penitence there, before reaching the peak, being cleansed of his sins, reuniting with his love Beatrice before taking a journey through Paradise. It is important to note that while Dante wrote himself as the main character of his work, he populated the underworld with many real (if often historical) figures. He knew howeer that the work he was writing was fictional, or allegorical, so this was not him preaching some prophetic vision. We know this, because some of his other works were likewise allegorical, e.g. Convivio, or The Feast, where he described literary or ethical debate as being like a banquet or feast, where everyone brings something to the table, everyone is nourished by the act and goes away richer than they arrived. 

Katabasis tells the story of the fictional character Alice Law, an American grad student studying in Cambridge, undertaking a PhD in analytical magic, with her fellow grad student Peter Murdock, only to have her PhD supervisor killed in a magical accident. The two decide to use their magic to journey to the underworld and bring their advisor back, so that they can graduate. Unlike Dante, her characters are all fictional, both in terms of the leads, and the characters that inhabit the Hell she depicts. Now, many have pointed the clear biographical links between Kuang and her main character, Alice (not like Dante didn't write himself into his own works, too), and of their romantic counterparts, but we can see while both works deal with themes of the underworld, the character motivations are different: Dante was merely lost, it was Virgil (acting at the behest of higher powers) that took Dante through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven, whereas Alice had explicit purpose and intention to travel the underworld.  

Yet aside from the intentions of the characters to contend with, there's also the intention of the creators. It can be interpreted that Dante's goal, as well as ingratiating himself back into Florentine society, or demonstrating God's divinity, was hoping to illuminate the forces within men that drive them apart (I'll comment on that further in this analysis). Meanwhile, Kuang, as well as wanting to expose some of the darker corners of the academic world and writing a love letter to works like Dante's Inferno, wanted to express her more complicated feelings of love for academia itself. Katabasis is billed as a love story in Hell, and while Alice and Peter's relationship do follow some tropes in the romance genre, I'd say it's Alice's (or really Kuang's) complicated love of academia that really drives the book. 

However, why I really wanted to talk about these books, is because both deal with the nature, or the structure of Hell. Most of this remaining post will just be a closer comparison with or inspection of the underworld that either author have created, as I've always been fascinated with works that deal with the underworld, especially when they want to put a new spin on it. This analysis can be quite deep and long, as it really is a niche interest of mine, hence my structuring this post into deeper and deeper dissections of either work. Feel free only to engage with the depth that captures of attention. 

# Broad Structure and Purpose of Hell 

Dante is known for designing a structure of Hell based around Nine circles, arranged in a hierarchy. The uppermost circles, closest to the surface world, punish lesser sins, with lesser punishments, yet the more egregious the sin is, the lower down it is placed, and the worse the punishment. On the other hand, Kuang devises a Hell based around Eight Courts, with the physical layout being ambiguous. Some characters see it as hierarchical like Dante, some see it the dimensions as instead being parallel to each other. Neither is really ""closer"" or ""further away"" though from the surface world though, as it exists in a kind of four-dimensional space, out of and away from the material world.  

As well as the structure however, there is also the spiritual purpose of either Hell. Dante's Hell was strictly a Catholic view of Hell. It housed some Deities from other belief systems (e.g. King Minos, Charon, Cerberus, Plutus, Phlegyas) but only really for being part of pagan belief systems not compatible with Christianity's monotheistic view of God (while still allowing Dante to acknowledge inspiration from some of his pre-Christian Greek and Italian forefathers, like Virgil). His view of Hell was for people who had intentionally or unintentionally moved away from God to be punished until Judgement day, whereupon their body would reunite with their soul and multiply their suffering further. He did allow some option for redemption for sinners through Mount Purgatory, for sinners who did believe and wanted to make right with God, so long as they could purge themselves of their sins, they could eventually end up in Paradise. In that way, Dante's works were instructive of how to live a virtuous life (or avoid a sinful existence) for those reading it back in the mortal world. But some of the many ""ironic punishments"" he devised in his construction of Hell/Purgatory (as well as being borrowed from some pre-Christian Greek and Italian classics) were supposed to be symbols of Gods divinity, as only a being as divine as God could create something so complex yet symmetrical as the Hell he described (which was ironic, given that he knew he was writing a fiction, hence this was his detailed vision, not God's). 

Meanwhile in Kuang's underworld, there are a mix of world religions at play here, while obviously taking some notes from Dante's Christian designs, there's also some classic Italian and Greek influences, like Orpheus's journey through Hades realm, Aeneas' journey through Tartarus, some mentions of some Mesopotamian or Egyptian under world beliefs, but on the whole is largely influenced by Chinese mythology, such as Lord Yama being the Lord of the Dead in this book and offering a type of karmic reincarnation. In Katabasis, souls aren't necessarily doomed to eternal punishment; the Courts system offers a series of trials that, if one can pass, they are granted reincarnation through Lord Yama. This does make the idea of a hierarchical hell a bit questionable then, as any soul would necessarily flow through all the courts before seeking reincarnation rather than being fixed in one place like in Dante’s depiction of Hell, but I'm still going to describe the souls in this book as if they are ""fixed"" in an hierarchical hell, for ease of communication. But, the idea of souls progressing through a series of tests before being cleansed/reborn/reincarnated via the river Lethe is if anything more akin to Dante's depiction of Mount Purgatory than it is of his Hell. 

# The environments of Hell 

Looking at a more detailed look: Between Dante's Circles and Kuang's Courts, some share themes, and yet others diverge. In the broadest overview, to Dante, the circles/landmarks were organised as such:  

- the Gates of Hell 

- the Antechamber (for souls awaiting Judgement; as they line up and trudge through mud, they are bitten by bugs and stinging insects, reminding them viscerally of God's presence, that they believed they could ignore in life) 

- the river Archeron (crossed with Charon) 

- Circle 1: Limbo (for the Virtuous Unbaptized, a dimly lit plain only illuminated by occasional plumes of fire, reminding the inhabitants of the dimness they experience in a life without God) 

- Circle 2: Lust (where souls are blown about by cyclones, just as their lives were swept up in the tempestuous nature of Lust) 

- Circle 3: Gluttony (souls are weighed down by their heavy bodies and fixed in place, hammered by pounding rain, and fed on by the Cerberus) 

- Circle 4: Greed (souls are tasked with pushing immense boulders back and forth, representing the wealth of possessions they hoarded in life) 

- Circle 5: Wrath and Sloth (wrathful souls thrash around endlessly in the muddy/boggy banks of the Styx, or slothfully drown to its waters) 

- the river Styx (crossed with Phlegyas) 

- The City Dis (where Hell stops representing a natural environment, and starts resembling a city, housing Medusa and her Gorgon sisters) 

- Circle 6: Heresy (souls are trapped within high-walled sepulchers as they burn eternally) 

- Circle 7: Violence (sub-circles: violence against others, where souls are chased by Centaurs and Minotaurs through the molten waters of the river Phlegathon, violence against self, where souls are turned into trees in the suicide forest, and fed on by Harpies, or violence against God, where souls March eternally through a barren desert with raining fires and embers) 

- Circle 8: Deception (sub-pockets: seducers, flatterers, simonacs, soothsayers, corrupt businessmen, hypocrites, thieves, usurpers, schismists and falsifiers). Almost too many to describe: seducers are whipped by horny demons, flatterers wade through deep pits of shit, simonacs are buried head down with their feet lit on fire, soothsayers are forced to walk backwards with their heads turned unnaturally around, corrupt businessmen are thrown into boiling pitch (by more horny demons), hypocrites are forced to march wearing heavy, lead vests, thieves are chased by snakes and reptiles, yet hideously fuse bodies when caught, usurpers are turned into disembodied flames, schismists are ripped in half from chin to anus, and falsifiers are cursed to endure Leprosy 

- and Circle 9: Treason, which houses the Devil (all souls are trapped frozen in ice to their neck) 

You'll note that the earlier sins (lust, gluttony, greed, wrath and sloth) are based on a lack of proper control over one's appetites and desires, which Dante termed the “sins of incontinence”. They are punished in or by rather natural looking environments (muddy rivers, bug bites, cyclonic winds, rain, boulders, etc). The latter sins however are ones of intention (Heresy, Violence, Deception, Treason) and are housed in more structured environments (the walled city of Dis, the concentric rings of Violence, the many pockets of Deception, another walled City in Treason). This is in part Dante's comment on the nature of the former sins being driven by natural desires not being properly curtailed, while the latter sins come from an intention of act, purpose or design (just like the natural vs structured environment). Yet another interpretation is that the wild environments of the upper Hell are a reflection of Dante being lost in the wild at the start of his journey (being exiled), yet as he journeys deeper, he enters environments more reminiscent of the walled city of Florence, indicating the moral failures of that city were perhaps born of these deeper sins, and with such he is brought closer and closer to his own Hell throughout his journey, being the failed state of Florence. In fact, part of Dante's motive was to depict the forces in men which turn them against each other or themselves (as I alluded to above), why, as well as the classic Christian demons, his Hell houses many half-man, half-beast creatures (Medusa and the Gorgons, Centaurs, Minotaurs, Harpies, etc.), symbolically representative of the forces that prey upon man turning against themselves. I should also note that each of these observations are ones I gained from the annotations and essays provided by the Robin Kirkpatrick translation of The Divine Comedy. 

Meanwhile, Kuang's Hell is organised as follows:  

- Asphodel (souls awaiting judgement, a barren plain where souls line up to enter the Gates of Hell, a large wall made of bone) 

- Court One: Pride (an infinitely spanning university Library, where souls are charged with writing an essay to ""Define the Good"") 

- Court Two: Desire (an infinitely spanning student centre, where souls imbibe from a fountain, which disinhibits them enough to act out their carnal desires in one of the many dorms throughout the centre) 

- Court Three: Greed (with the bridge of sighs, where souls become stones or tiles as part of the bridge's construction, for a sentence of certain years; which later leads into the desert of Greed, where souls fight back and forth with primitive weapons over the same stretches of sand). It also houses one of the scattered deities in this underworld, being The Weaver Girl, who offers a Prisoner's Dilemma type bargain to sojourners in this region. 

- Court Four: Wrath (a bog with the writhing souls of the undead contained below its surface) 

- Court Five: Violence (a mountainous region, with scattered geometric boulders and ""Escher traps"" which are used by the Kripke's, antagonists throughout the book, to capture their victims with) 

- Court Six: Cruelty (a barren desert with scattered, abstract geometric objects, and souls undergoing self-imprisonment in cages of bone) 

- Court Seven: Tyranny (A campus-like Clock tower, where souls are again encased within the brickwork) which also houses the Erinyes, deities which can see directly into your soul, study your worst sins, and grant or refuse entry into the last court 

- Finally, there is the Eighth Court (Oathbreakers, for people who have gone against their promised words to others, who once again are tasked with writing a life's essay or dissertation, pleading for their own reincarnation) 

- Within this Court is the City of Dis (an elaborate walled city, more reminiscent of a highly architectured church or the Sistine Chapel, which the souls have made in defiance of their imprisonment in Hell). It also houses many further deities such as Nessus and Laplace's Demon 

- All are bordered by the river Lethe, whose waters cleanses you of all memory, with finally Lord Yama's throne sitting outside this entire structure. Passage to Yama’s throne is only granted once shades have rectified themselves of all past sins. 

At first you'll notice that Kuang's Hell is structured as a university or college Campus. Just as Dante constructed a Hell that was familiar of his life (the architecture/city of Florence), so too does Kuang create an environment similar to her own (the world of academia). This is something that many other writers have displayed before e.g. William Blake in his poem The Marriage of Heaven and Hell made a design of Hell that was similar to a printing press or publishing house, which was notable as he self-published and printed his own pamphlets and poetry, so such an environment was intimately familiar to him. Furthermore, Steven L Peck, himself a doctorate level academic, also designed a Hell that took the form of an Infinite Spanning Library (modelled after Borges' The Library of Babel) in his novella A Short Stay in Hell. Kuang at least offers an in-universe reason for this, and why so many depictions of the underworld look like the life of the author describing their hell: that death can be a disorientating experience, so the afterworld has something of a plastic nature to it which constructs itself around the inhabitants’ own perceptions (more on that in the comments).  

But further than that, just as Dante's Hell went from wild to civilised or architectured environments, you can see Kuang's Hell goes from structured (the Library, the student centre, the Bridge), to wild and natural environments (the deserts of Greed, the bog, the mountains, the barren lands of cruelty) before returning to highly architectured environments (the clock tower and the City of Dis). As the character Elspeth puts it, this represents the ""degeneration of the psyche"". This journey from familiar to wild and back follows the Alice’s character arc, from feeling sure of what she knew of herself, her relationships, her life, and what her mission was in Hell from the start of the story, before being exposed to several revelations that slowly tear away at her pre-conceived views of what she thought she knew of the world and those around her, before a large character revelation in Court Five, Violence, where the character starts building their identity and perceptions back up again into a new direction, just as they return to more architectured environments again. 

Another point of comparison, the river Lethe is found at the peak of Mount Purgatory in Dante's text, not in Hell, as Kuang describes it. Though in both it cleanses you of your past life/sins/memory and acts as a kind of Baptismal imagery. Therefore, Kuang's Hell takes on elements equally from Inferno and Mount Purgatory. 

# A closer comparison between the texts 

The first environment of Dante's Hell is the Antechamber, a vestibule (not a circle in itself) where souls await Judgement by King Minos to be placed into their respective circle of Hell. Dante and Virgil here are escorted by Charon across the river Acheron (not Styx, which has its place later). The first proper circle of Hell is Limbo, a dim plain illuminated only by occasional plumes of fire, housing the souls of the ""virtuous unbaptized"", people who lead virtuous lives but for reasons often out of their control were never baptized or introduced to Christian society, beliefs and practices, (i.e. Dante knows his inspiration, Virgil, would be branded as a Pagan by his Christian beliefs, but in creating Limbo as the least punishing circle of Hell, he basically creates an environment of Hell exempt from the usual suffering of Hell for figures such as Virgil that he respects).  

Kuang's first environment is similarly a dim plain, but composed of sandy dunes of ash, illuminated only by a low lying, red son. Souls likewise mill around here as they await to be processed. This is termed the Viewing Pavilion, where souls can just barely interact with an inverted version of the material plane. Kuang explicitly relates this environment to that of the Antechamber/Limbo of Dante's Hell, intentionally engaging with that text. Kuang also points out that this pavilion, like the Antechamber, is not a proper Court/Circle of Hell, only a temporary holding space. (Note: Kuang doesn't have a court similar to Dante's first circle, as her underworld is intentionally polytheistic, and so she does not condemn “pagans”). 

The first Court of Kuang's Hell however is Superbia, the Court of Pride. Dante did not have a circle dedicated to Pride in his version of Hell, but in Mount Purgatory, it was the lowest terrace, the least egregious sin and the easiest to purge. Dante believed that Pride wasn't wrong to feel, so long as you felt it as the pride in your works, and that your works were directed towards deepening your understanding of or honouring God, e.g. his own craft of the Divine Comedy, a poem of 100 Cantos, could be regarded with pride without sin (according to Dante), as it was in service to God. In Purgatory, souls dwelling in this terrace carry boulders across marble floors (thus labouring towards a certain craft, like stone masonry), in a room designed with detailed stone-masonry carvings of religious significance, such that the inhabitants here may also learn to create great works of art honouring God. To Dante, the environment (of Mount Purgatory at least) directs the individual inside that environment into achieving an elevated morality. 

In Kuang's Superbia, this court is described as a library, with marble floors, wooden bookshelves, stained glass windows with religious imagery, evoking an environment like the first Terrace of Mount Purgatory. This library is said to be so elaborate as the better the library is, the better work you can do inside of it. Once again, the environment is directing the inhabitants towards moral development, through industrious work they take pride in. The inhabitants here are tasked with/commanded to ""Define the Good"" in essays that they write, again their environment here quite literally directs them in a task that may elevate their morals or purge them from the sin of Pride. 

Yet, a unique challenge appears in Kuang's First Court, in the form of the character George Edward Moore. One important difference between Katabasis and The Divine Comedy are the two leads, and their relationships to each other. In Inferno, Dante inserts himself as the lead character and inserts Virgil (a poet some century/millennia his senior, whose works likewise elevated Italian history and culture) as a guide. Virgil has a paternal attitude towards Dante in The Divine Comedy, always protecting him, leading him, and he is depicted as morally resolute by Dante. Alice and Peter are the two leads of Katabasis, but they are peers, of virtually equal footing, neither can truly guide the other as Virgil does Dante (not to mention the questionable morals of either). So when the two leads from Katabasis arrive in the first Court, they meet Moore, who offers to lead them, yet more accurately, he misleads them. (Other guides will be discussed below). 

Moore ignores the direction to “Define the Good”. He pridefully scorns and gossips over the other inhabitants and chooses to appoint himself as the ""Dean of the Library"". Moore quite clearly is not a suitable moral guide on the purging of prideful behaviours. Alice and Peter cannot be guided out of Pride by someone who knows no way out and has no intention of leaving or bettering himself. Furthermore, Moore constantly tries to flatter Peter, and play to his sense of Pride, trying to appeal to him as both of their being ""Cambridge men"", playing to their elitism and male chauvinism. It's only Alice learning to intentionally break away from her (socially learned) prideful behaviours (where she recalls a similar incident where she bought into institutional pride and snobbery, which was quashed at Professor Grimes' command) that they can exit the library and move past this court. 

The second Court in Katabasis is Desire, a complex amalgam of both lustful and gluttonous appetites. This thus shares themes in common with both the second and third circles in Dante's Inferno, Lust which features cyclones blowing lovers together and apart, and Gluttony, which punishes shades with immobilising rains, and predation by Cerebus. The journey to the Court of Desire in Katabasis is marked by certain obstacles: first, bone creators, that Peter mistakes for the Cerberus (note: the bone creatures are not limited to this court however, making an increasing appearance throughout the book. As well, Cerberus would make his appearance proper later in Katabasis, in the CIty of Dis), and next, an eternally raging storm (though this rain does not immobilise anyone, unlike in Dante's Inferno, yet there are strong winds that blow you towards the Court itself, to hamper your exit, thus again similar to both of Dante’s circles of Lust and Gluttony).  

Once inside the student center of Desire, Alice is immediately repulsed, both by the dilapidation of the building, and the single-minded acting out of carnal desires by the inhabitants. Alice and Peter relate that the meagre living of a Cambridge grad student affords them an appreciation for an ascetic lifestyle, making them impervious to the wants and temptations of Desire. Alice internally recalls another moment of her late Professor Grimes asking her of her desires, only for her unable to offer up a suitable suggestion (at least in this moment of time), which again buffers her of the sin of desire. But, from this point on, the main characters are not really purged of their sins in life, as they are not dead, and unlike Dante they aren't tasked with bringing the word of God's enlightenment to Earth. 

The next court is that of Greed (circle four to Dante). To Dante, Greed was one of the ""sins of incontinence"", i.e. a sin due to the lack of restraint in human drives. To Dante, these were sins that only really affect the sinning individual, not other people. Kuang intentionally contrasts this viewpoint in her depiction of Greed. To Kuang, greed can absolutely be an intentional sin, rather than one of incontinence, and as well can harm other people, not just the sinner itself. This is represented in three examples: the story of Bill Cadeaux, whose greed led them to intentionally sabotage their colleague Hollis Galloway. It is also represented with the Cooke scholarship, which only Peter or Alice could win, not both, where one's triumph means another defeat. This is furthermore demonstrated again in the Prisoner's Dilemma contest that the Weaver Girl has both Peter and Alice play, where one person's greed can absolutely lead to the other's detriment. In terms of the tests that Kuang's Hell requires, this is one test that her main characters failed. The environment of the Third Court is as well an architectured environment (the Bridge of Sighs, in contrast with the natural environments of Dante), which could also therefore imply greed as an intentional act, which shows Kuang not just inheriting but consciously engaging in the view of the underworld, as well as the discussion of moral ethics underpinning such representations, as suggested by Dante. 

Before reaching the next Court, Peter and Alice meet Espeth, a Cambridge colleague preceding their scholarship, and a suicide death (as well as a partial guide to the pair. Just as Virgil was a predecessor and teacher to Dante, so too is Elspeth here, both in terms of their academics in life, and in the knowledge of the underworld they possess in death). The autonomy and freedom Espeth is afforded in Hell presents an interesting contrast to Dante's Hell. In The Inferno, Dante depicts suicide deaths as belonging to circle 7, where these shades are transformed into trees and fixed in place as part of the ""Suicide Forest"". Thus Elspeth journeying through all eight Courts of Hell and beyond marks another intentional deviation from the viewpoint of Dante. While Violence exists as a Court of Hell in Kuang's story, Elspeth doesn't have any particular ties there. 

Moving on though, following Greed to Dante is a circle that encompasses both sins of Wrath and Sloth. The wrathful souls thrash endlessly in the bogs of the River Styx, meanwhile the slothful souls mournfully rest at the bottom of the river. Dante and Virgil meet Phlegyas here, who ferries them to the City of Dis and Circle 6, Heresy (note: Kuang states Dante posits Dis as within the final circle of Hell. While there is a city wall in his final circle,  Treason, and it could be argued that Dis encompasses all environments from circles 6 through to 9, it still could be remarked that Dis first appears at the circle for Heresy, and that worse sins remain to be punished below). Kuang nonetheless alludes to some of these concepts from Dante's fifth circle as Peter and Alice sail upon Elspeth's Neurath. First, the two looking into the Lethe's watery depths see images of faces, lives and people in the water, which turn out to be memories from mortals up above. This reminds Alice of the slothful souls in the Styx. Not only that, but the far reaches of Greed are a dessert of endless fighting, just like Dante's wrathful souls. Phlegyas as well exists as a deity within this court, just as he was a ferryman at this point in the Inferno (though his description is quite different to his depiction within the Inferno). But in Kuang's actual Court of Wrath, the bog itself serves as another allusion to Dante’s text, depicted here as a bog with shades residing below its depths (just like the slothful shades of the Styx), that  writhe, claw at and attack passersby (just like the wrathful shades of Styx), which thus makes it probably the closest in its depiction to one of Dante's environments of Hell. 

Saving a discussion of Dis for later, Dante's seventh circle is Violence, subdivided into three concentric circles: those who committed violence against others, those who committed violence against themselves, and those who committed violence against God. For Kuang, the three Courts of Violence, Cruelty and Tyranny could be considered similar to Dante's 7th Circle in being three courts/circles sharing the common theme of violence, differing by shades of intensity or intention. It is observed by Alice in the text that cruelty really could be considered an extension of violence by intensity or intentionality, as is tyranny to cruelty. This is seen metaphorically as well, as there is very little geographically dividing the courts of Violence, Cruelty and Tyranny, being one long, continuous, barren wasteland. As a small note, this is the only Court where no shades are encountered (implied to be victims of the Kripke's hunting, itself an obvious act of violence).  

Tyranny returns Alice to campus-like environments, featuring a clock tower whose stonework is composed of encased shades (just like the shades making up the earlier Bridge of Sighs). The tower is guarded by three Erinyes, who admit only the most wicked souls to the Eight Court, and the City of Dis. (As an aside: this piece of world building, just like the sentencing terms required of shades composing the Bridge of Sighs complicates a comparison of Kuang’s underworld with Dante’s depictions of either Hell or Purgatory. In the Inferno, souls are fixed in their location in Hell. They are not there to learn a lesson, as their punishment is eternal. The lesson is really there to be learned by the reader, hence Dante bringing back word of the divinity of God back to the living world. In Mount Purgatory, shades do progress through all terraces, gradually purging themselves of sins, before acceptance into Paradiso. Kuang’s underworld is a blend of either of Dante’s underworlds, yet here is where we can see a conflict emerge between the two models. If shades in Kuang’s underworld are to progress through each Court to complete their transcript before reincarnation, then why would the Erinyes only admit the worst sinners? Wouldn’t they be required to admit all sinners? Furthermore, if sinners are to show a learning process, or purging of sin, then why are souls in the Bridge of Sighs given a sentencing length rather than a moral task? e.g. one soul says he was required to be present for 3 years before progressing. So, are souls really learning/purging themselves of sin, or just passing arbitrary terms of confinement? It really is only a minor complaint and doesn’t really hurt the overall product of the book, but I thought I’d mention it as part of my comparison here). 

Beyond the Circle of Violence for Dante however is the Circle of Deception (for abusing the trust in strangers/people who had no reason to trust in you) then the final Circle, representing Treason (betraying the trust of those who had reason to trust in you, e.g. community, country, family, and God). Being a hierarchical Hell, this houses the worst sinners in the afterlife, including Lucifer himself. Kuang's Eighth Court likewise hosts the worst shades, those who break oaths to others, analogous to Dante's Circles of Deception and Treason. This desert is littered with torn pages of handwriting, as souls are tasked with writing dissertations on their life and making a moral case for reincarnation (just like the essays in Court One). Yet, the shades in this court, as is their deceitful nature, deny or rationalise their sins, and demand their immediate reincarnation or release from Hell in spite of any moral development on their own part. Not only does the task of essay writing echo the task given in Court One, but so too does the errant guide in the form of John Gradus, someone who likewise has no intentions of righting themselves of their sin or following along with the task of essay writing. (Jumping ahead however, again Kuang’s worldbuilding can be critiqued here, as >!Gradus is offered reincarnation simply from helping Alice to defeat the Kripke's (thus keeping an Oath he made her), rather than writing the essay he was actually charged with. He still shows moral development, purging himself of prior sins, but the nature, structure and purpose of Kuang's hell is confusing given this relevation, as this example is at odds with the assigned task of that court!<). 

At the center of the Eighth Court is the City of Dis, beautifully architectured and reminiscent of The Vatican or the Sistine Chapel. The shades here have constructed their own immaculate city in defiance of their own hellish environment, reminiscent of John Milton's Paradise Lost: ""The mind is its own place, and in itself/Can make a heav'n of hell, a hell of heav'n"". We see a similar sentiment echoed in Kuang's writing, ""Damn us, and we will make Hell shine"". Again, we see how the perception of Hell changes the nature of Hell itself, as the shades, dismissive of the reality of their sins and their environment, have constructed something so holy and grand, and so out of place to their current reality. 

Inside Dis are many rooms or sub-environments. This is similar to the multi-pocketed architecture of The Malbolge in Dante's Circle 8, except the Malbolge were putrid and hostile, in contrast to the immaculate beauty and order of Dis in Kuang's text. These room are: 

First a huddle of academics watching one submit a potential dissertation. The acceptance/rejection process is similar to the process depicted by Steven L Peck in A Short Stay in Hell, where souls are likewise tasked with finding one book describing their life which once submitted will allow transfer to heaven. The very act of the ""dissertation"" process is just an academic aesthetic layered on top of the Christian practice of confession, that one’s life can be atoned for, and salvation secured, so long as one confesses their sins, up to the moment of death. 

The next room is a writer's bazaar, with peddlers offering resources, services or short cuts in preparing your dissertation, where it is said the over-crowded and attention demanding nature of the Bazaar acts as an intentional distraction from your duty to deliver your dissertation/truth. In that way, it is similar to Buddhist principles of Viksepa, anything that would distract you from your journey to discover the true nature of reality, and thus act as a barrier to enlightenment. 

The third room is the Workshop, where academics work to review each other's confessions, or debate the metaphysics of Hell, the afterlife, reincarnation or eternal damnation. Professor Gertrude, a soul residing here, even channels Milton's Paradise Lost, Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, or Nietzsche to argue against the desire to confess one’s sins and rebirth. She heads the Rebel Citadel, souls who refuse their own call towards reincarnation. She also acts as another false-guide to Alice, just as Moore and Gradus had been before. 

Gertrude takes Alice to a winding garden path, bordered by hedges, yet as it turns out, these hedges are the transformed bodies of the Rebels, so opposed to the idea of moral progression that they have fixed themselves in place. While the imagery can seem similar to the Suicide Forest as described by Dante, I'd say it is more familiar to the imagery of William Blake's poetry. Specifically, it is reminiscent of Orc/Satan, becoming a tree in Hell, in defiance of Urizen, in Blake’s prophetic work Vala: The Four Zoas. Orc was himself a very Miltonian figure, based around the Lucifer from Paradise Lost, so it is well fitting with the motivation of the Rebel Citadel.  

Thus, from all of this, we can see the entire environment of Dis is one great fraud to the many fraudsters inside. Alice is so distraught by this information that she flees Dis entirely. In the wild barrens of Court Eight, she finds and fights a tiger, which reinvigorates her, redirects her and sets her on a new course of action for the final stretch of the book. Following her fighting the Kripke’s and being exposed to the Lethe, Alice's tattoo (which had magically and permanently fixed her memories) is washed away in the River Lethe. This is akin to Dante purging himself of sin on Mount Purgatory, cleansing himself of the seven marks left on him by the Angel, and then crossing the River Lethe before reaching Paradise. 

I won't go into a description of Lord Yama's throne, as that does seem more intentionally a description of East Asian Buddhist mythology rather than Dante's view of Christian Heaven, but I will point out that the last line of Katabasis is a re-interpretation of the last line of Dante's Inferno, ""Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.""",76,38,dant inferno book return read adult favourit read

Possible Plot Hole?/Thoughts about Philip Lombard in Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None book,"\*\*\*SPOILERS\*\*\*

I just finished And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie last night, and I'm confused about Captain Philip Lombard..

I'm referring to the last chapter, when Vera and Philip are alone out on the cliffs (?) after they found Dr. Armstrong's body that was washed up, and after they discovered that Blore was crushed by the marble bear from Vera's bedroom window.

Once Vera figures that the killer 'must' be Philip, she says, ""How was it worked- that trick with the marble bear?"". The book states that Philip shrugs his shoulders and says, ""A conjuring trick, my dear- a very good one..."".

....

Philip doesn't deny killing Blore with the marble bear (!!) Making it seem to Vera (AND THE READER - or at least, to me) that Philip was the killer the whole time and had somehow accomplished all of those murders on his own, and is a master of creating traps and misdirection from his experiences out on ""the field"". And was paid to do these murders, cause he was on a job, which the reader was basically told at the beginning of the book.

BUT apparently Justice Wargrave committed ALL of the murders?? And Philip had nothing to do with ANY of them??? And Philip didn't care to wonder about the true murderer or how they were done, NOR who the \*eff JUST killed Blore when they thought it was just those two left on the island in that final moment with Vera? Or he thought that Vera did all of those (or some of) the murders??? (Which I don't think he did).

I mean, was Philip just such a shifty character and was more concerned with shooting Vera, that he didn't care to clarify his confusion in how Armstrong or Bear were murdered??? And we're just supposed to not wonder about this character at all just because he was shot so quickly in the end, without having any conversation about the murders or the job he was on at all between he and Vera?

Did anyone else wonder about this??

At the very least, I would've thought that Philip would've also known about Wargrove being alive, aside from Dr. Armstrong, for him to not care about how Blore died while he and Vera were out on on the cliffs.

Did I miss something?

"Just finished We Love You, Bunny and it was really… misogynist… am I wrong?","I added the Spoiler tag but really, this is all going to be spoilers for this book and the preceding book Bunny. 

There’s a TL:DR

I know Mona Awad is a feminist satirist. I know she’s “the heir apparent” of Margaret Atwood, according to Atwood. I loved *All’s Well* and *Rouge.* That’s why I’m so confused by this book. Am I missing something? I must be, right? Because this was one of the most appallingly misogynist books I’ve read in a long time.

If anyone can help me see what I missing, I would be so grateful. (Or if you think I’m right and if this was by a guy it would be absolutely pilloried, I’d be interested to hear that too!) 

So…

To prepare for reading it I reread **Bunny.** It’s a biting satire of MFA programs, and as someone who worked at a college with a prominent one I really enjoyed that part – but I was uncomfortable with the bunnies. Partly with having that kind of performative femininity with the braids and the dresses and the upspeak be an endless comedy target in itself, but also— especially— the ending where they are all turned against each other by being fucked by the same man, whom they all lose their minds over, who exposes them as frenemies… That part wasn’t great.

More “Mean Girls” than not.

But there are so many other things I love about the book. She writes so beautifully. You are on Samantha’s side throughout. So…

On to **We Love You, Bunny**

So this is a prequel, set the year before. Here we learn more about the bunnies and they are constantly presented as pathetic and evil objects of scorn – we are invited to mock their bulimia, horrific self-harming, their horrible treatment by their parents – but some of that isn’t funny? 

Their friendship is also fake from the beginning, they all secretly hate each other, we all know these kinds of girly girls can’t be *real* friends. 

**Silly Girls Being Triggered**
I was unpleasantly surprised when Awad went fullbore mocking students being “triggered” – honestly, it read like she was channeling Charlie Kirk. The scene where Coraline’s work is destroyed in the writing workshop and she cries in the garden and yes, hyperbolically says that she feels violated, and the other bunnies comfort her, is presented as something over the top and ridiculous— so stupid that almost all the men in the book make fun of it at one point or another. 

As a reader, though, I didn’t have any trouble empathizing with Coraline in that moment. It’s would be awful to have that happened to you, people critiquing you whose names you hadn’t even learned yet, and I’m not sure about shaming her for holding it together in the workshop but crying afterward, and her friends hugging her? Why is that so stupid? Why are we supposed to agree with the men shaming her for that?

**Women Just Need to Get Laid— And Older Women Are a Bit Gross**

So they create a boy, Aereus, and then they have to hold onto him because *of course* they have no talent of their own. Despite the fact that I thought in both books their writing sounded kind of interesting, obviously you’re not supposed to think that. And these women are nothing without a man.

They’re not the only ones of course. Their teacher, Ursula, who is older, also has no talent without a male muse.

Did we need to describe the older woman as both “barren” and “withered”? Apparently.

So you have these women chasing this male muse all over the city. (The bunnies are actually also trying to keep him from committing murder, which seems like a good thing…? I mean, shouldn’t he be locked up?)

**Men Are Wise and Creative**

Let’s talk male characters.

We have Jonah, who is perfect, as in the first book.

We have Aereus, who is the male muse whom every woman in the book needs to take inspiration from and also wants to fuck desperately. 

We have Allan, who was a predator in the first book, and a real asshole to his students in this one, but has **deep and profound wisdom** to impart because he doesn’t need a muse. 

He’s a man. He’s creative all on his own. 

And then we have the male poets who also keep Aereus as a muse, and here you might think they would be equivalent to the bunnies. But they are not. Masculinity is not in any way satirized. The poets are not shown to be fake friends. Their decor, food choices, histories, are never mentioned. They barely exist as characters, to be fair.

**TL:DR  What am I missing?**

How is any of this, any of it at all, feminist? Am I supposed to be laughing at Coraline‘s self-harm or agree with the men shaming a girl for daring to cry after a brutal critique of her prose? How do I understand all the older men being brilliant  artists but the older woman being “barren” and “withered” as a feminist statement?

If you know, let me know.

Thoughts on Universality: Satire without a point?,"After it's placement on the Booker Prize longlist this year, Universality has been getting a fair amount of attention, which is frankly impressive for a satire that manages to say almost nothing.

There's certainly satire, the book clearly dislikes the current right-wing obsession with anti-wokeness and anti-DEI; it rips apart the ""intellectual dark web"" types, race ""realists"", IQ believers, and the rest of the current alt-right. At the same time, however, it paints left-leaning activists in as much a negative light. Too obsessed with identity and largely just lazy bums who abandon their leftist ""principles"" as soon as it becomes convenient for them. The book seems to say ""Isn't the anti-woke crowd a bunch of grifting racists,"" while at the same time adding, ""But maybe the left is too woke. Maybe DEI is bad after all.""

None of the characters are truly sympathetic, but it's telling, perhaps, that the only character portrayed in first-person during the novel is the politically scattered Lenny. She's ostensibly feminist, but not really, believes that racism and sexism aren't real problems, only classism, and scorns the left as being too woke. In other words, she's functionally JK Rowling. While the book goes to great pains to tell you she has no coherent ideology, her ideology is center-right, and while she is critiqued, the book seems to suggest, ""She might lie to others, but at least she's honest with herself.""

Now, I will say, as a socialist myself, that a class-focused lens is the one I use in politics, but not to the point that I deny the existence of racism, sexism, or other prejudices. Certainly, leftists believe class to be the largest driving force in politics, but the whole point of intersectionality, which in many ways has dominated the 2010s and 2020s, was to show that the combination of identities leads to unique experiences within the social structure.

Brown herself muddies the waters further. I confess, I haven't read her other book, and I've only read a few interviews, but she seems as politically scattered as Lenny, though perhaps not holding all the same beliefs. She, too, seems to find DEI useless, at least from the interviews I've seen. She also finds STEM to be more fruitful than the arts, a common opinion among right and center-right thinkers. She's black, but also spent years in finance, so certainly Lenny's ""class first"" approach to right-populism fits a certain worldview among people who are marginalized by race, but not class. Do I think she's right-wing? Probably not, although it's hard to say. Certainly, she holds some right-wing views it feels.

All of this would be fine, frankly. A book which disagrees with me politically isn't exactly a scandal, nor does it make the book bad. But I wonder what the point of satire is. In my mind, satire exists to critique, yes, but with purpose. It doesn't just point and say ""isn't this dumb,"" it has an argument about the way the world should be. Universality seems to say that the world should be, more or less, exactly how it is now. That yes there are problems, but the people who claim to want to solve them are just as bad. Yes there are racists and bigots, but they're largely fringe. The end message is one of milquetoast centrism, that things should be as they are and that the biggest divide is one on class, but that those who support a change to the class structure are wrong. In other words, it's exactly the kind of do-nothing political messaging that made it sure to create buzz among the liberal intelligentsia, and thus secure it's Booker longlist.

What do others think? Am I missing the point? Is there a point?

"Reminder to start a ""A night in Lonesome October"" tomorrow!","It's that time of the year! So for those new to the tradition, and for those who do it every year, it's time to dust off the most classic October read

""A night in lonesome October"" by Roger Zelazny is a fun mix of gothic horror, humor, and mystery, featuring Jack the Ripper’s dog as narrator (yes, really). 

The book is made of 31 chapters, each set in one of October's days. Traditionally you read each chapter on its day, with the finale on All Hallows Eve.

Today I finished Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. I wish I could read it again for the first time.,"This was a 5/5 read. It took me about 3 months to read the whole thing, but it was worth every minute. Margaret Mitchell 100% deserved the Pulitzer Prize. I wish I could experience it again for the first time. 

I went into this historical novel thinking it was going to be a beautiful love story (it is said to be the “greatest love story of all time”), and it was the complete opposite. It’s brutal, raw, and Scarlett O'Hara is emotionally incapable of experiencing love. It’s bold of Mitchell to make her main character so unlikable. The ending with the famous line “I don’t give a damn” was perfect. I honestly might reread the last chapter again. I think my favorite part of the novel is the timeline of life before, during, and after the civil war. It really could be considered a Great War novel as well. Though, I recognize it’s not at all accurate and romanticizes slavery and the south. It was hard to get through some of this, especially how she wrote the black characters’ dialogues and the reoccurring racial slurs. That being said, it was interesting to read someone’s perspective who thought this way. It made me think about how when we are in school we are mostly taught the civil war from the north perspective. The winning side gets to tell history, as they say. 

I hope if you haven’t read it yet, you’ll give it a read. I enjoyed it a lot and will probably come back to it again. I would love to hear from others who also read it. Thanks!

Surveying Invented Languages and Their Speakers: Survey Results,"(posted with permission from the mods)

A couple of months ago, I posted to several subreddits, asking for participants for a survey I conducted as part of my PhD dissertation. In it, participants listened to 18 audio clips of \~30 seconds, in which I recorded passages from the following invented languages

* Adûnaic; Black Speech; Khuzdul; Quenya; Sindarin (JRR Tolkien)
* Dothraki; High Valyrian (here specifically from *Game of Thrones*)
* Klingon (*Star Trek*)
* Na’vi (James Cameron’s *Avatar*)
* Simlish (Electronic Arts *The Sims*)

as well as two of my own invented languages and six “sketches” I made specifically for the survey in order to test linguistic theories about positive or negative evaluations of specific speech sounds and combinations thereof. Participants were asked to assign adjectives from a list to these sound samples, as well as decide which roles in fantasy or science fiction would fit the languages best. They were asked if they recognised the language and to speculate where in our world this language might be spoken if it was a natural (that is, not an invented) language.

In total, 90 people were kind enough to take the survey. Since I have finished evaluating the responses I received, I wanted to give everyone an overview of the results.

\---------------------------

My survey was split into **two parts**—a listening section, followed by more general questions about participant demographics, prior knowledge of invented languages, and opinions about their usage in fiction. In this post, I will only show you the results of the listening section, since that was the biggest and most important part.

The **questions** participants answered were:

1. What adjectives would you use to describe the sound of this invented language?
   1. good
   2. evil
   3. peaceful
   4. aggressive
   5. pleasant
   6. unpleasant
   7. beautiful
   8. ugly
   9. soft
   10. harsh
   11. melodic
   12. discordant
   13. civilised
   14. barbarous
   15. familiar
   16. unfamiliar
   17. Other: **\[free typing field\]**
2. Do you recognise this invented language?
3. What role would you expect the speakers of this invented language to perform in a classical fantasy or science-fiction story?
   1. a people who live in harmony with the natural world around them. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.
   2. a people who place much importance on honour, combat prowess, and strength in all matters of life. They often stand in conflict with other people but aren’t necessarily evil.
   3. an ancient, noble, and mystical people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.
   4. a people whose history is much younger compared to that of other species in the world. They are often a jack of all trades when it comes to magic or mystical abilities, though rarely true masters, and highly adaptable.
   5. a small, jovial people who value comforts such as food, drink, leisure, and peace more than personal glory or wealth. They are often overlooked by members of other species but are just as capable of great deeds.
   6. a violent people known to raid and pillage other settlements. Either they are the main antagonists of their setting, serve a greater power of evil, or work with it for their own gain.
   7. an industrious people who are renowned for their craftsmanship and skills as smiths and creators of functional yet beautiful works of art. To outsiders they seem gruff and short-tempered, but they are also noble and value honesty and honour.
   8. a massive empire that controls a vast territory with many citizens. They are highly advanced in many aspects such as industry, technology, military, and artistry. They either violently subjugated surrounding peoples or reign over them peacefully.
4. If this was a natural (that is, not explicitly invented) language, where in the world would you expect this invented language to be spoken natively? **\[this question included a map with the world regions highlighted in different colours\]**
   1. Western Europe
   2. Central and South Eastern Europe
   3. Eastern Europe and Central Asia
   4. North America
   5. Latin America
   6. North Africa and the Middle East
   7. Sub-Saharan Africa
   8. Asia and Pacific
   9. Other: \[free typing field\]
   10. Unsure / Don’t want to say

**Without further ado, let’s see how participants rated the invented languages.**

# 1) Adûnaic (JRR Tolkien)

Adûnaic is one of the languages JRR. Tolkien invented for his world, Arda. It was the native tongue of the Númenóreans and was spread by them throughout Middle-earth. Westron, the common speech or lingua franca among the Free Peoples of the West (which Tolkien ‘translated’ into English in his novels), descends from Adûnaic. It seems to be heavily inspired by Semitic languages such as Hebrew.^(1)

The passage I used has been named the “Lament of Akallabêth” and can be found in the journal *Vinyar Tengwar*, number 24.

^(1) See for example Zak Cramer, “Jewish influences in Middle-earth”, jstor.org/stable/45320162.

The 3 **adjectives** chosen the most for Adûnaic are **harsh (14%)**, **pleasant (11%)**, and **unfamiliar (10%)**. **2** people further thought that it sounded **serious**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Adûnaic are

* “a massive **empire** that controls a vast territory with many citizens. They are **highly advanced** in many aspects such as industry, technology, military, and artistry. They either violently subjugated surrounding peoples or reign over them peacefully.” **(21%)**
* “an **industrious people** who are renowned for their **craftsmanship** and skills as smiths and creators of functional yet beautiful works of art. To outsiders they seem gruff and short-tempered, but they are also **noble and value honesty and honour**.” **(16%)**

2 people **recognised** Adûnaic; 2 rightly attributed it to Tolkien, though one of those responses misidentified it as Khuzdul/Dwarvish; 1 person said it reminded them of Dovahzul (from Bethesda’s *Skyrim*); and 5 people either thought it comes from *Game of Thrones* or misidentified it as Dothraki.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **33%** located it in **North Africa and the Middle East**. 4 people thought it could belong to the Semitic language family and 1 specifically compared it to Hebrew.

# 2) Black Speech (JRR Tolkien)

The Black Speech of Mordor is one of the languages JRR Tolkien invented for his world, Arda. It was created by the Dark Lord Sauron and was meant to be the language spoken by all his servants and subjects, though these efforts ultimately failed.^(1) The Ring Verse (“ash nazg…”) is written in this language.

The passage participants heard is a combination of words Tolkien coined but wouldn’t immediately be recognised and words I created following the rules and ratios Tolkien used.

^(1) *The Lord of the Rings*, Appendix F:I.

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for the Black Speech are **harsh (23%)**, **discordant (13%)**, and **unfamiliar (11%)**. **2** people thought it sounded **powerful and strong**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of the Black Speech are

* “a massive **empire** that controls a vast territory with many citizens. They are **highly advanced** in many aspects such as industry, technology, military, and artistry. They either violently subjugated surrounding peoples or reign over them peacefully.” **(21%)**
* “an industrious people who are renowned for their **craftsmanship** and skills as smiths and creators of functional yet beautiful works of art. To outsiders they seem gruff and short-tempered, but they are also **noble and value honesty and honour**.” **(16%)**

2 people **recognised** the Black Speech; 2 rightly attributed it to Tolkien, though one of those responses misidentified it as Khuzdul/Dwarvish; 1 person said it reminded them of Dovahzul (from Bethesda’s *Skyrim*); and 5 people either thought it comes from *Game of Thrones* or misidentified it as Dothraki.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **33%** located it in **North Africa and the Middle East**. 1 person was reminded of Russian, 2 of German, and 1 person said it either sounds like a Middle Eastern or a Central Asian language.

# 3) Dothraki (here specifically from Game of Thrones)

Dothraki is the language spoken by the horse riders of the same name that George R.R. Martin invented for his *A Song of Ice and Fire* universe. When HBO adapted the novels for their TV show Game of Thrones, they hired the language creator David J. Peterson to expand upon the languages Martin invented. The lines participants heard were from the TV show.

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for Dothraki are **soft (13%)**, **pleasant (13%)**, **familiar (9%)**, **melodic (9%)**, **peaceful (9%)**, and **unfamiliar (9%)**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Dothraki are

* “an **industrious people** who are renowned for their **craftsmanship** and skills as smiths and creators of functional yet beautiful works of art. To outsiders they seem gruff and short-tempered, but they are also **noble and value honesty and honour**.” **(16%)**
* “a massive **empire** that controls a vast territory with many citizens. They are **highly advanced** in many aspects such as industry, technology, military, and artistry. They either violently subjugated surrounding peoples or reign over them peacefully.” **(15%)**
* “a people who place much importance on **honour, combat prowess, and strength** in all matters of life. They often stand in conflict with other people but aren’t necessarily evil.” **(15%)**

4 people **recognised** Dothraki and 2 rightly attributed it to *Game of Thrones*. 1 person was reminded of the constructed language Keva, 1 of *Avatar*, and 1 person said that “\[i\]t doesn't sound like a Conlang. Kind of feels like Celtic/Gaelic/something Scandinavian”.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **28%** located it in **North Africa and the Middle East**. Other associations are with Semitic languages (4), Scandinavian (2), German (1), “African” (1), and Persian/Farsi (1).

# 4) High Valyrian (here specifically from Game of Thrones)

High Valyrian was the language of the Valyrian Freehold and the native tongue of the Targaryens from George R.R. Martin’s *A Song of Ice and Fire universe*. The lines participants heard were from the TV show.

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for High Valyrian are **melodic (16%)**, **soft (16%)**, **pleasant (13%)**, and **peaceful (12%)**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of High Valyrian are

* “an **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.” **(27%)**
* “a massive **empire** that controls a vast territory with many citizens. They are **highly advanced** in many aspects such as industry, technology, military, and artistry. They either violently subjugated surrounding peoples or reign over them peacefully.” **(19%)**

13 people **recognised** High Valyrian; 1 rightly attributed it to the language inventor for *Game of Thrones*, David J. Peterson, though misidentified it as Shiväisith (*Thor: The Dark World*), just as another was reminded of the *Dune* movies which Peterson also worked on (*Dune Part 1* and *Dune Part 2*). 1 person said it reminded them of Na’vi; and 1 of *The Lord of the Rings*.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **30%** located it in **Western Europe**. 2 thought it could be a Romance language, 1 that it could be Latin, another located it in Scandinavia, 5 in Finland, and 2 in Greece.

# 5) Khuzdul (JRR Tolkien)

Khuzdul is the tongue of the Dwarves which J.R.R. Tolkien invented for his world, Arda. It was given to them by their Maker Mahal, whom the Elves call Aulë, and they guard it as a secret few outsiders ever learned.^(1) It is very deliberately based on Semitic languages such as Hebrew, which highlights the comparison Tolkien himself made between his Dwarves and Jewish people.^(2)

^(1) The Lord of the Rings, Appendix F:I

^(2) See for example Zak Cramer, “Jewish influences in Middle-earth”, jstor.org/stable/45320162.

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for Khuzdul are **harsh (15%)**, **unfamiliar (10%)**, and **melodic (10%)**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Khuzdul are

* “a people who place much importance on **honour, combat prowess, and strength** in all matters of life. They often stand in conflict with other people but aren’t necessarily evil.” **(25%)**
* “an industrious people who are renowned for their **craftsmanship** and skills as smiths and creators of functional yet beautiful works of art. To outsiders they seem gruff and short-tempered, but they are also **noble and value honesty and honour**.” **(20%)**

7 people **recognised** Khuzdul and 2 rightly attributed it to Tolkien, though 1 misattributed it to Mordor. 2 people guessed it was Klingon and 2 that it was Dothraki. 1 person guessed that it comes from *Game of Thrones* and 1 that it is Na’vi.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **28%** located it in **North Africa and the Middle East**. 3 people specifically mentioned Semitic languages and 2 German.

# 6) Klingon (Star Trek)

Klingon is the language spoken by the aliens of the same name from the *Star Trek* franchise. It was principally developed by Mark Okrand and was meant to sound ‘alien’, so Okrand included sounds and sound combinations that speakers of English generally wouldn’t be familiar with.^(1) It is one of the most widely known invented languages and has a large fan base of speakers across the globe, such as the Klingon Language Institute.

The passage participants heard was a combination of several sentences [taken from the Klingon Wiki](https://www.klingonwiki.net/En). The last line, for example, was the beginning of the famous soliloquy from the Klingon version of Shakespeare’s Hamlet.

^(1) See for example Okrand et al. “‘Wild and Whirling Words’: The Invention and Use of Klingon”, in *From Elvish to Klingon: Exploring Invented Languages*

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for the Black Speech are **harsh (26%)**, **discordant (15%)**, and **unpleasant (14%)**. **2** participants also called it **strong and powerful**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of the Black Speech are

* “a people who place much importance on **honour, combat prowess, and strength** in all matters of life. They often stand in conflict with other people but aren’t necessarily evil.” **(30%)**
* “a **violent** people known to **raid and pillage** other settlements. Either they are the main antagonists of their setting, serve a greater power of evil, or work with it for their own gain.” **(28%)**

38 people **recognised** Klingon outright, with 1 additional person correctly attributing it to *Star Trek*. 2 people even wrote short comments in Klingon. Another person said it could be from *The Witcher*.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **25%** were unsure or did not want to guess. 18% located it in North Africa and the Middle-east and 16% in Eastern Europe or Central Asia. 2 people said it did not sound like a human language; 1 person was reminded of Semitic languages and 1 person compared it to French.

# 7) Na’vi (James Cameron’s Avatar)

Na’vi is spoken by the aliens of the same name from James Cameron’s *Avatar* movie franchise. It was developed by Dr. Paul Frommer and has, as of now, two variants spoken by the forest and reef Na’vi featured in the movies. It has a large community of learners across the globe who have even contributed to the development of the language itself.

The passage participants heard consists of several sentences taken from [Dr. Paul Frommer’s blog about the Na’vi language](https://naviteri.org/).

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for Na’vi are **unfamiliar (13%)**, **discordant (11%)**, and **harsh (11%)**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Na’vi are

* “a people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.” **(32%)**
* “a people who place much importance on **honour, combat prowess, and strength** in all matters of life. They often stand in conflict with other people but aren’t necessarily evil.” **(15%)**

18 people **recognised** Na’vi (since I also posted the survey to Na’vi language servers, this high recognition rate is unsurprising).

Regarding **location** in the real world, **37%** located it in **Sub-Saharan Africa**. 2 people specifically mentioned South Africa, where most click languages are found. It seems likely that participants equated ejectives (as in *Kal****tx****ì*) with click consonants.

# 8) Quenya (JRR Tolkien)

Quenya is the language spoken by the Noldor Elves of J.R.R. Tolkien’s invented world, Arda. By the time of the Third Age, in which Tolkien’s novels take place, it has primarily become the language of “ceremony, and for high matters of lore and song”.^(1) It is heavily based on Finnish but also includes elements from Latin and Greek.

The passage participants heard was from the poem “Markirya”, of which several versions can be found in *The Monsters, and the Critics, and other Essays*, as well as in *A Secret Vice: Tolkien on Invented Languages* (2020).

^(1) *The Lord of the Rings*, Appendix F:I.

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for Quenya are **melodic (20%)**, **soft (15%)**, and **pleasant (14%)**. **2** people further thought it sounded **ancient**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Quenya are

* “an **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.” **(37%)**
* “a people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.” **(24%)**

3 people **recognised** Quenya; 4 identified it as “Elvish”, and 4 rightly attributed it to Tolkien. 1 person said it reminded them of High Valyrian.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **25%** located it in **Western Europe**. 1 person was reminded of Latin and another person of Finnish. 2 located it somewhere in Poly-, Austro-, or Melanesia, and 3 somewhere in Scandinavia.

# 9) Simlish (Electronic Arts’ The Sims)

Simlish is the language spoken by the eponymous characters controlled by the player in *The Sims* video game franchise by Electronic Arts. It was first used in 1996 in *Sim Copter* and was created as an emotive language with which the players could tell their own stories^(1). Many singers such as Katy Perry or the Black-Eyed Peas have re-recorded songs in this language.

The passage participants heard comes from the Simlish version of Bebe Rexha’s song *Sabotage*, which I transcribed.

^(1) See for example James Portnow, “Gaming Languages and Language Games”, in *From Elvish to Klingon: Exploring Invented Languages*.

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for Simlish are **soft (18%)**, **pleasant (13%)**, and **peaceful (11%)**. **3** people further thought that it sounded **playful**, **funny**, or **goofy**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Simlish are

* “a people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.” **(28%)**
* “a people whose **history is much younger** compared to that of other species in the world. They are often a **jack of all trades** when it comes to magic or mystical abilities, though rarely true masters, and are **highly adaptable**.” **(18%)**

1 person **recognised** Simlish. Someone said it reminded them of Trigadeslang (*The 100*), another that it sounds like something from *Star Wars*, and 1 person compared it to English.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **23%** located it in **Western Europe**. 3 people specifically said that it reminded them of English.

# 10) Sindarin (JRR Tolkien)

Sindarin is one of the languages J.R.R. Tolkien invented for his world, Arda. It is the native tongue of the Sindar, the Grey Elves, and many of the place and character names in Middle-earth are taken from it. Sindarin was deliberately designed by Tolkien to be similar to Welsh,^(1) which can be seen in its sound, grammar, and other linguistic aspects.

The passage participants heard is from the King’s Letter, which Tolkien wrote for an abandoned epilogue to *The Lord of the Rings*, as well as a sentence from *The Unfinished Tales* into which I added a word to include the *lh* /ɬ/ sound.

^(1) See for example Tolkien, “English and Welsh”, in *The Monsters and the Critics, and Other Essays*.

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for Sindarin are **melodic (17%)**, **soft (14%)**, and **pleasant (12%)**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Sindarin are

* “an **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.” **(42%)**
* “a people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.” **(22%)**

6 people **recognised** Sindarin; 9 identified it as “Elvish”, and 7 rightly attributed it to Tolkien. 1 person was reminded of Astaporian Valyrian from *Game of Thrones*.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **36%** located it in **Western Europe**. 6 people located it in Scandinavia, 4 people said it sounded Celtic or Gaelic, and 1 person was reminded of Latin.

\---------------------------

**For the following samples, you need** [a little knowledge about the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/content/full-ipa-chart) (link leads to the full chart). The IPA categorises speech sounds according to their manner and location of articulation. Sounds made, for example, with both lips, such as /m p b/, are called *bilabial* consonants. /p b/ are *stops*, which are articulated by stopping and then releasing the flow of air, while /m/ is a *nasal* consonant, as air flows through the nose.

# 11) Sketch 1

One of the sketches I made specifically for this survey. This sketch only features labial (made with the lips), coronal (with the tongue), and palatal (at the hard palate in the middle of the mouth) sounds, the one exception being /h/. It is heavily skewered towards sonorants such as nasals and liquids, only has two voiced stops /b d/, uses far more front vowels /a e i/ than back vowels /u o/, and has a lot of long vowels.

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for Sketch 1 are **soft (20%)**, **melodic (18%)**, and **peaceful (14%)**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Sketch 1 are

* “an **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.” **(32%)**
* “a people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.” **(31%)**

1 person thought Sketch 1 was Sindarin and 9 that it was one of Tolkien’s (Elvish) languages. 2 people thought it comes from *Game of Thrones*.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **33%** located it in **Western Europe**. Other associations are Celtic/Gaelic (1) and Scandinavian (2).

# 12) Sketch 2

One of the sketches I made specifically for this survey. This sketch uses many stops and fricatives and combines them in clusters of up to four consonants. It only has the velar nasal /ŋ/, so no /n/ and /m/, and features a lot of other velars /k g x ɣ/, as well as the uvulars /q/ and /ʀ/, and the glottal stop /ʔ/. It uses far more back vowels /u o ɑ/ than front vowels /i e a/ and more short vowels than long ones.

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for Sketch 2 are **harsh (20%)**, **discordant (19%)**, and **unpleasant (16%)**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Sketch 2 are

* “a **violent** people known to **raid and pillage** other settlements. Either they are the main antagonists of their setting, serve a greater power of evil, or work with it for their own gain.” **(27%)**
* “a people who place much importance on **honour, combat prowess, and strength** in all matters of life. They often stand in conflict with other people but aren’t necessarily evil.” **(26%)**

5 people thought that this was Klingon. 1 person guessed that it came from *Star Trek*, 1 from *Avatar* and 1 from *Star Wars*.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **28%** located it in **Eastern Europe and Central Asia**. 2 people were reminded of Russian and 2 of German(ic) languages.

# 13) Sketch 3

One of the sketches I made specifically for this survey. This sketch uses a combination of sounds made at the front of the mouth and sounds made at the back of it. It thus stands directly in the middle of two other sketches (Sketch 1 and Sketch 2) in which I use predominantly (or exclusively) front or back sounds respectively. In this sketch I used exactly the same amount of front and back sounds and included consonant clusters of no more than two consonants.

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for Sketch 3 are **harsh (13%)**, **melodic (10%)**, **pleasant (10%)**, and **unfamiliar (10%)**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Sketch 3 are

* “an **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.” **(18%)**
* “an **industrious people** who are renowned for their **craftsmanship** and skills as smiths and creators of functional yet beautiful works of art. To outsiders they seem gruff and short-tempered, but they are also **noble and value honesty and honour**.” **(18%)**
* “a massive **empire** that controls a vast territory with many citizens. They are **highly advanced** in many aspects such as industry, technology, military, and artistry. They either violently subjugated surrounding peoples or reign over them peacefully.” **(14%)**

2 people thought it could be from *Game of Thrones*, with one specifically mentioning Dothraki.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **22%** were unsure or declined to assign one. **20%** thought it could be from **Western Europe** and another **20%** that it could be from **Central and South-Eastern Europe**.

# 14) Sketch 4

One of the sketches I made specifically for this survey. This sketch is very similar to another one, in which I exclusively use consonants made at the front of the mouth (so labial, coronal, and palatal) with the exception of /h/, and predominantly the front vowels /a e i/. The difference between that sketch and this one is that I have included the two velar sounds /x ɣ/ and the glottal stop /ʔ/ to test whether this small addition is enough to affect the way participants evaluate this sketch compared to the other one.

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for Sketch 4 are **harsh (13%)**, **melodic (13%)**, **pleasant (13%)**, and **unfamiliar (11%)**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Sketch 4 are

* “an **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.” **(25%)**
* “a people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.” **(16%)**

2 people thought that Sketch 4 could be Sindarin, while 3 thought it was some form of “Elvish”. Other guesses include Na’vi (1) and Hildegard von Bingen’s “unknown language” (1), likely meaning Lingua Ignota.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **32%** located it in **Western Europe** and **28%** in **North Africa and the Middle-east**.

# 15) Sketch 5

One of the sketches I made specifically for this survey. This sketch is very similar to another one in its predominant use of sounds made at the front of the mouth (so labial, coronal, and palatal) with the exception of /h/, and the preference for front vowels /a e i/. What differentiates this sketch from that one is the inclusion of something akin to lexical tone, though very exaggerated. In tonal languages, the meaning of a word or word segment can differ depending on the pitch with which it is said. This sketch is meant to test whether tones affect the way participants evaluate this sketch compared to the other one.

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for Sketch 5 are **melodic (21%)**, **unfamiliar (19%)**, and **unpleasant (11%)**. 6 people called it **robotic**, 6 other people **alien**, and 2 **fun** or **jolly**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Sketch 5 are

* “a people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.” **(30%)**
* “an **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.” **(20%)**
* “a **small, jovial** people who **value comforts** such as food, drink, leisure, and peace more than personal glory or wealth. They are often overlooked by members of other species but are just as capable of great deeds.” **(20%)**

3 people thought Sketch 5 could be Solresol, an invented language that is sung or played on musical instruments.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **34%** located it in **Asia and the Pacific**; **3%** narrowed this down further to **(South)East Asia**. **31%** were Unsure and **12%** said that it was like **no natural** language, **alien**, or **robotic**.

# 16) Sketch 6

One of the sketches I made specifically for this survey. This sketch uses so-called click consonants, which are only found in [1.8% of the 449 languages analysed by Ian Maddieson on WALS Online](https://wals.info/chapter/19), all of them coming from southern and eastern Africa. It also has an unusually low vowel inventory with only three sounds, /a i u/. Combining these incredibly rare sounds with the most common consonants found in languages worldwide,^(1) I am testing whether unfamiliar sounds affect the way participants evaluate this sketch compared to the other ones.

^(1) See the [UCLA Phonetics Lab](https://phonetics.linguistics.ucla.edu/sales/software.htm#upsid).

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for Sketch 6 are **unfamiliar (16%)**, **discordant (11%)**, and **melodic (10%)**. **5** people called it **fun(ny) or jolly**, **2** **“click-y”**, **2 “primitive”** **or “tribal”**, and **2 interesting**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Sketch 6 are

* ·“a people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.” **(33%)**
* “a **small, jovial** people who **value comforts** such as food, drink, leisure, and peace more than personal glory or wealth. They are often overlooked by members of other species but are just as capable of great deeds.” **(18%)**

1 person thought this was Na’vi; 1 that it was Kelen or Itkul, two constructed languages; 2 that it comes from *Star Trek*, and 1 that it comes from *Star Wars*.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **73%** located it in **Sub-Saharan Africa**, with **10%** being more specific with **South Africa**. Xhosa (3), Zulu (1), Khoisan languages (1), and Hausa (1) were mentioned, out of which all but Hausa are natural click languages.

# 17) Tàrhama

Tàrhama is one of my own invented languages which I have been working on for several years. Its speakers are a humanoid species of aliens with nine sub-species, each of which has its own language that descends from Tàrhama. In creating the phonology of Tàrhama, I only used sounds and sound combinations that I enjoy or find interesting.

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for Tàrhama are **unfamiliar (14%)**, **harsh (13%)**, and **pleasant (11%)**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Tàrhama are

* “an **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.” **(19%)**
* “an **industrious people** who are renowned for their **craftsmanship** and skills as smiths and creators of functional yet beautiful works of art. To outsiders they seem gruff and short-tempered, but they are also **noble and value honesty and honour**.” **(17%)**
* “a people who place much importance on **honour, combat prowess, and strength** in all matters of life. They often stand in conflict with other people but aren’t necessarily evil.” **(17%)**

1 person thought Tàrhama could be from *The Lord of the Rings*; 1 from *Star Trek*; and 1 that it could be High Valyrian.

Regarding **location** in the real world, **25%** located it in **North Africa and the Middle East**. 2 were reminded of German and 2 of Semitic languages.

# 18) Wi:çǫthashìgä

Wi:çǫthashìgä is one of my own invented languages and is part of a language family which I have been working on since June 2024. The language family, and its alien speakers, are very deliberately based on the Haudenosaunee and their Iroquoian languages.

The three **adjectives** chosen the most for Wi:çǫthashìgä are **soft (14%)**, **melodic (13%)**, and **pleasant (11%)**. Unsurprisingly, given the inclusion of nasal vowels (as in French), **2** people called Wi:çǫthashìgä **nasal**.

The two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Wi:çǫthashìgä are

* “a people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.” **(23%)**
* “an **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.” **(17%)**

Guesses about which invented language this is include “Tolkien’s Elven languages” (1), “Avatar Na’vi” (1), and *Star Wars* (1).

Regarding **location** in the real world, **24%** located it in **Eastern Europe and Central Asia** and **23%** in **North America**. 1 person specifically mentioned Native American languages and guessed “\[m\]aybe Iroquoian, maybe Algonquian”.

\---------------------------

If you have made it this far, thank you for your time. I’d like to once again thank all participants. The survey will be immensely useful for my PhD dissertation and future research in this field. It is possible that my results will be published in an academic journal, so keep an eye out for that, if you are interested.

How do you power through that one detail that soils the story?,"Writing this puts me at the risk of exposing myself to some members in a book circle, but I must rant. 

Currently I'm reading Maja Lunde's book ""Binas Historia"" (title translates to ""history of the bees"", I don't think the book is translated to English). The only reason I'm reading it is to participate in a book circle, and while it's overall quite good I would have stopped reading it before the first chapter was over if it wasn't for the book circle.

Apparently, together with bees, ladders have also gone extinct by the year 2098. One of the characters has to hand pollinate the flowers of fruit trees (many chapters later revealed to be pears), and the description goes to great lengths describing what a gruelling job it is for her, and how bad we should feel for the workers who have to... climb the fruit trees to manually pollinate them? Climbing up and standing on branches? To reach the *flowers*? All this while the fruit trees are so valuable that the character is terrified of breaking the branches?

The thing is, I've grown up with fruit trees. I've spent a lot of weekends helping my dad prune fruit trees and pick fruit. Standing on the branches is absolutely asinine because we have **ladders**. You don't even have to lean them against the tree, you can use the A-shaped ones that can stand on their own to reach far out branches! 

Meanwhile I'm not sure if this author has ever even seen a full-sized fruit tree. I want to know what kind of trees she's envisioning when she's writing the pollination scenes. Into what shapes have those trees been pruned?? Just to accommodate this lack of ladders???

It's such a small detail but I can't get over it. **Everything else** in the book so far has been quite fine, and very realistic, but just as I had almost gotten over the tree climbing in the first chapter, a later chapter casually reveals that they also climb the trees to pick the fruit.

Now I really want to know what the author was thinking.

Even if all ladders have gone extinct together with the bees, even if for whatever reason you can't surround the tree with fruit harvesting nets, you still don't need to climb trees to pick fruit! We've got fruit pickers for that! It's a long stick with a bag at the end. Raise the stick until the fruit is in the bag. Wiggle it just a little. Ripe fruit will fall of the branch and into the bag. You get a crick in the neck doing it too long but! You don't need to climb the tree! At all! It's a very simple tool, you can make it yourself with items foraged from your local junk yard!

Also, I know that the author knows that ladders exist, because other parts of the book take place in 2007 and during one of those chapters one the characters use a ladder to remove a lightbulb. 

So, apparently, at some point between 2007 and 2098 ladders go extinct. Possibly more extinct than the bees - people still think about bees. Ladders have seemingly just vanished from their reality and the character at no point wistfully think ""people used to have ladders for this"".

...

Anyway, that was an awful lot of words to say that I'm going completely insane and tearing my hair over a detail that so far isn't even remotely plot relevant, it's an objectively insignificant line presumably only added to make a character more pitiful and yet I can't get past it. Anyone out there got any advice for how to compartmentalise really annoying little details so they're less frustrating to read?

I read Lord of the Flies,"
It was really interesting. I loved the dynamics, I felt certain archetypes were very real especially Ralph, Jack and Piggy. It made me think a lot on how certain types are and how the interactions go. Honestly, my only disappointment was that I had read it was a horror book and I expected more horror or supernatural things, and I kept waiting for Lord of the Flies. The scene was still very interesting.

I think some scenes were lost on me, especially with the locations. I kept reimagining some parts. Also at times I felt the writer was going somewhere but wasn't, such as when one of the biguns holds the kid to talk about the beast, and the kid sagged and yawned. It was preceded by the line ""something strange happened"", which gave it a certain otherworldly air, and I had assumed at first that the kid had entered an unusual stage. But he was just sleepy.

2 things stood out to me; Simon and Ralph seemed to be ill. Simon isn't just introverted, he faints and sees the pig head talking, which made me think that he was taking medications before and was now off them. Ralph kept losing his train of thought, which made it seem like he had some condition.

Glad I read it, though. After Lord of the Rings I managed to read this in only a few days.",50,46,realli interest love dynam felt certain archetyp real especi ralph jack piggi made think lot certain type interact go honestli disappoint read horror book expect horror supernatur thing kept wait lord fli scene still interest think scene lost especi locat kept reimagin part also time felt writer go somewher wasnt one bigun hold kid talk beast kid sag yawn preced line someth strang happen gave certain otherworldli air assum first kid enter unusu stage sleepi thing stood simon ralph seem ill simon isnt introvert faint see pig head talk made think take medic ralph kept lose train thought made seem like condit glad read though lord ring manag read day,positive,1,0
"Finished My Year of Rest and Relaxation, I loved it... but I understand why people hated it","I adored this book, but I also completely understand why many weren't impressed with it or even despised it. It has pretentious, filthy rich literary characters being shitty and doing nothing, the bane of so many worse literary novels. Literally, she does almost nothing. She sleeps, she wakes up, she takes pills, she blacks out and does something crazy and we never learn exactly what, she takes more pills and sleeps again. And she suffers basically no consequences, physically or mentally from taking a dozen sleeping pills a day FOR A YEAR. Even though Reva, the unnamed MC's friend, is just as messed up as the MC in certain ways, she's the only thing tethering the MC to the real world, and she consistently pushes Reva away... until the end, which you can tell what's going to happen about three quarters of the way through.

On the other hand, I was in the mood for a book like this, where the MC is unlikeable, nearly unredeemable, not because they're inherently bad, but because they're so fucking vapid they can't see out of their own head. Depression is like that, though. The MC's wealth doesn't keep her from horrible depression that she disguises with her possibly fatal self help routine. The only good thing she has to say about herself is that she's still pretty, even after wasting away to nothing from sleeping pills. She hangs desperately, pathetically onto the memory of her awful ex boyfriend, because her parents showed her no empathy and she wants to be mistreated by someone. Attention = love. That's extremely relatable, even if she's too far gone in her own head to be totally sympathetic.

My favorite character, though, is Dr. Tuttle. She is an amazingly insane character, and a much-needed comic relief in the bleakness of the book, prescribing anything and everything she can get her hands on and rambling about stuff that isn't even pseudoscience, just health theories that make no sense. If there were any justice or sanity in that world, she'd lose her license, (or wouldn't be allowed to get one in the first place,) but that's besides the point.

It's the kind of book you have to be in a certain headspace to read, and that's OK.

Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir.,"Just completed reading this book. It's a really good book and I recommend it to everyone. It has the cinematic narrative style, Is it common for new books?
I loved this style, where there’s a connection between what’s happening now and the events that took place back on Earth.

I loved every part of the book especially after he met Rocky. The ending was very thrilling and I just can't expect the outcome and I was late for work but I completed it anyway then I started my work. 

Are there any fan theories about how the earth survived those dark days and how they got the Beatles?

Do you guys usually read a book in one stretch, or do you take a few days to finish it slowly? Which works best for you?",248,164,complet read book realli good book recommend everyon cinemat narr style common new book love style there connect what happen event took place back earth love everi part book especi met rocki end thrill cant expect outcom late work complet anyway start work fan theori earth surviv dark day got beatl guy usual read book one stretch take day finish slowli work best,positive,1,0

Review - Look Closer by David Ellis,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐⭐️ — 5 stars is the only acceptable rating for this book.

I was locked in from the very start taking notes, making charts. The deeper I got, the more excited I became. Taking all the information and trying to piece everything together...When the full picture started to reveal itself I was floored, bamboozled, curfuflled. Absolutely shook. 

I absolutely loved everything about this book. If you haven’t read it yet, I highly recommend it especially since the story is set around Halloween, making this the perfect time to pick it up and get ready for spooky season. 

And for those who have read it… what do you think?

The Dead Secret by Wilkie Collins (1857),"This novel was written just before a turning point in Wilkie Collins career: his follow-up novel was *The Woman in White*, a breakthrough work for him and one of the first and best sensation novels, as well as one of the first mystery novels. It's intriguing to speculate what happened in between, because while *The Dead Secret* is a competent and entertaining bit of spooky storytelling, it shows little of the subsequent novel's much more complex, intriguing characterization and plotting.

But it's still a good little page-turner on the theme of how “dead secrets” are only playing dead. Collins displays his customary fascination with the law, money, sex, ambiguous identities, and physical disability. Sensation too is provided through hinky aristocratic doings on the Cornwall coast and a haunted North Wing. (In my head, the book is illustrated by Edward Gorey.) 

The mysteries—of why prematurely gray-haired lady's maid Sarah Leeson departed Porthgenna Tower on the night of her mistress's death; the oaths she swore; her attachment to little Rosamond; the gravestone she visited; and the letter, the Dead Secret, she hid in the Myrtle Room—these are all easily penetrated. But as Collins explained in a preface to the third edition: ""I thought it most desirable to let the effect of the story depend on expectation rather than surprise."" And the interest of this novel lies not in detecting the mystery but in watching its unspooling.

After the mysterious events of the opening chapter, the story begins again some 15 years later. Rosamond Treverton has married a Mr. Frankland, recently afflicted with blindness, and the two are travelling to Porthgenna, purchased from Rosamond's father before his death, where Rosamond plans to give birth. But the child is a month early, and the two must halt along the way and engage a nurse. The only one available, it turns out, is a Mrs. Jazeph, who is hiding her previous identity. She seriously freaks out Rosamond with her strange behavior—especially the whispered injunction: ""*When you go to Porthgenna, keep out of the Myrtle Room!*""

Of course, nothing could make Rosamond more fiercely determined to discover the Myrtle Room and search it from top to bottom. As in Collins's *Poor Miss Finch*, blindness becomes a moral challenge for the seeing, who can easily be tempted to hide or alter what sight would reveal, whether for the blind person's own good or for other reasons. Money, too, is a Victorian test of character, and both the Franklands are put to the test. Whether they pass their tests; whether the whole truth becomes known; whether all is set right in the end—that I leave you to guess.",32,1,novel written turn point wilki collin career followup novel woman white breakthrough work one first best sensat novel well one first mysteri novel intrigu specul happen dead secret compet entertain bit spooki storytel show littl subsequ novel much complex intrigu character plot still good littl pageturn theme dead secret play dead collin display customari fascin law money sex ambigu ident physic disabl sensat provid hinki aristocrat do cornwal coast haunt north wing head book illustr edward gorey mysteriesof prematur grayhair ladi maid sarah leeson depart porthgenna tower night mistresss death oath swore attach littl rosamond graveston visit letter dead secret hid myrtl roomthes easili penetr collin explain prefac third edit thought desir let effect stori depend expect rather surpris interest novel lie detect mysteri watch unspool mysteri event open chapter stori begin year later rosamond treverton marri mr frankland recent afflict blind two travel porthgenna purchas rosamond father death rosamond plan give birth child month earli two must halt along way engag nurs one avail turn mr jazeph hide previou ident serious freak rosamond strang behaviorespeci whisper injunct go porthgenna keep myrtl room cours noth could make rosamond fierc determin discov myrtl room search top bottom collinss poor miss finch blind becom moral challeng see easili tempt hide alter sight would reveal whether blind person good reason money victorian test charact frankland put test whether pass test whether whole truth becom known whether set right endthat leav guess,neutral,0,0
